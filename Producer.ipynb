      "Sent thread to ActiveMQ: {'thread_id': '1iy10nf', 'author': 'pizzadoodd', 'title': 'Goujian sword is bai yue history, not Chinese', 'selftext': 'You’re probably thinking of the Goujian Sword (越王勾践剑), which was discovered in Hubei, southern China, in 1965. It is one of the most well-preserved ancient swords ever found, dating back to around 500 BCE, during the time of the state of Yue (越国).\\n\\nWhile China claims it as a Chinese cultural artifact, the truth is that the state of Yue was heavily influenced by Bai Yue culture. This means the sword is more likely a Bai Yue artifact rather than a purely “Chinese” one.\\n\\n1. What is the Goujian Sword?\\n\\n\\t•\\tMade of: Bronze with high tin content, making it highly resistant to corrosion.\\n\\t•\\tAge: ~2,500 years old (Spring and Autumn Period, ~500 BCE).\\n\\t•\\tFound in: Hubei province, in a tomb.\\n\\t•\\tInscription: “越王勾践自作用剑” → “King Goujian of Yue made this sword for his personal use.”\\n\\n2. Who was King Goujian of Yue?\\n\\n\\t•\\tGoujian (勾践) was the ruler of the state of Yue (越国), a kingdom that existed in modern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian.\\n\\t•\\tHis kingdom was heavily connected to the Bai Yue people.\\n\\t•\\tHe is famous for defeating the rival state of Wu (吴国), another Bai Yue-influenced kingdom.\\n\\n👉 Key Fact: The state of Yue was not fully Han Chinese—it was influenced by Bai Yue culture. Ancient Chinese texts even described them as semi-barbaric and different from the northern Chinese states.\\n\\n3. Was the Sword Bai Yue or Han Chinese?\\n\\n✅ Bai Yue elements:\\n\\t•\\tThe Yue kingdom was located in Bai Yue lands.\\n\\t•\\tThe sword-making techniques resemble those found in other Bai Yue artifacts.\\n\\t•\\tAncient texts describe Yue warriors as tattooed, barefoot, and seafaring—similar to Bai Yue culture.\\n\\n❌ Han Chinese elements:\\n\\t•\\tThe writing on the sword is in Chinese script, since the Yue kingdom adopted Chinese writing.\\n\\t•\\tLater Chinese historians wrote about Yue as if it were part of Chinese civilization, erasing its Bai Yue origins.\\n\\n👉 Conclusion: The sword is technically from a Chinese-speaking kingdom, but that kingdom was culturally and ethnically Bai Yue. So while China claims it as “Chinese history,” it is more accurately Bai Yue history that was later absorbed into China.\\n\\n4. The Pattern: Bai Yue Artifacts Rebranded as “Chinese”\\n\\nThis fits into the broader pattern of China claiming Bai Yue history as its own:\\n\\t•\\tGoujian Sword (500 BCE): A Bai Yue king’s weapon, but now a “Chinese national treasure.”\\n\\t•\\tBronze Drums (东山铜鼓 - Đông Sơn culture, Vietnam &amp; Guangxi): Used by Bai Yue people, but now called “Chinese ethnic minority artifacts.”\\n\\t•\\tRice Cultivation (Yangtze River ~10,000 years ago): Likely started by Bai Yue ancestors, now claimed as “Chinese innovation.”\\n\\t•\\tFish Sauce &amp; Fermented Foods: Originally Bai Yue, now seen as just a “regional” Chinese food tradition.\\n\\n5. The Real Story\\n\\nChina today promotes the Goujian Sword as a symbol of ancient Chinese craftsmanship, but the Yue Kingdom was not fully Chinese at the time. It was a hybrid state, Bai Yue in culture but influenced by northern Chinese administration.\\n\\nIf China was being historically accurate, it would say:\\n\\t•\\t“This sword comes from a Yue king, who ruled over Bai Yue-influenced lands.”\\n\\t•\\t“It represents early southern Chinese civilization, which included non-Han cultures.”\\n\\t•\\t“The Bai Yue people played a key role in metallurgy and military technology.”\\n\\nBut instead, China erases the Bai Yue connection and says “this is a 2,500-year-old Chinese sword, proving China’s long history.”\\n\\n6. Final Thoughts\\n\\nYes, China is taking credit for Bai Yue history with the Goujian Sword. The Yue Kingdom was not fully Chinese—it was heavily Bai Yue-influenced, and its people had distinct cultural traits. But because China eventually conquered the region, the Yue’s history (and its artifacts) were absorbed into the “Chinese” narrative.\\n\\nWould you like to go deeper into other Bai Yue artifacts or how China systematically rebrands indigenous histories as its own?', 'link_flair_text': 'History/Lịch sử', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 0, 'upvote_ratio': 0.3, 'over_18': False, 'is_self': True, 'distinguished': None, 'stickied': False, 'locked': False, 'external_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1iy10nf/goujian_sword_is_bai_yue_history_not_chinese/', 'created_utc': '2025-02-25T17:48:41'}\n",

Our starting point was Hai Cafe in the old town center where we met our English speaking head chef and tour guide and were each provided a welcome drink of robust Vietnamese coffee. This was followed by a trip to the Central market to see locals working with food, have a look at the fresh produce for the day and we were taught how to pick fresh herbs and spices. We then took a picturesque motor boat ride up the Hoi An River where we got to see local life along the river as well. The boat took us directly to the cooking school on the banks of the river. The cooking school was open-air and set to the backdrop of the calm riverside scenery which was pleasant.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the cooking school, demonstrations were given on how to make 4 different dishes: fresh rice paper salad rolls with shrimp, Hoi An pancakes or banh xeo, seafood salad with Tra Que vegetables, and Quang noodle soup with chicken/beef. They even accommodated two of our vegetarian group members with their own ingredients. We were then taught how to cut food decorations, of which my rose tomato looked absolutely horrendous.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThe best part of the tour was chowing down on all the dishes for lunch. The lunch included a dish that wasn’t part of the cooking class: steamed ocean fish on a bed of fresh veggies. My favorite dish was the Hoi An pancakes or banh xeo, which was similar to the banh khoai from the day before. My second favorite dish was the Quang noodle soup, as the umami flavors and mix of ingredients was a delectable combination. All in all, it was an enjoyable tour as the tour guide/chef Duy was personable and funny.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter the cooking class, we got to enjoy the pool outside the cooking school for about an hour before it started to rain. The boat ride back to town was a bit hectic with the rain. Most of us got wet, but thankfully I stayed in my swimming trunks. When we got back to the town center, everyone freshened up before heading out to Old Town for a bit of exploration.\\n\\n\\n\\nI decided to go for a quick ca phe sua da (iced coffee) at a nearby coffee shop. As the sun started to set, the rain stopped completely leaving a reflection of lights on the city streets. Most of the group met up and rode bikes through the lantern lit streets of Old Town. Hoi An is as beautiful as ever and riding along the streets feels like you’re riding through history in this historic trading town. Looking around here I can see Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese and European influences all around. During the ride, we had to be careful to not hit any tourists on the busy streets.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the late evening, the group decides to unwind at Market Bar in Old Town for food and a cold beverage. It’s a rooftop bar that can easily be missed when walking by. Market bar is not a big bar but we enjoyed bar seating with a view of the bustling street life below. I’m not going to lie, after indulging in mainly Vietnamese food during the first part of our trip, I couldn’t wait to order a plate of fish and chips. The fish was battered and fried well for a nice crunch. The gin and tonic I ordered was strong. The group seemed generally happy with their orders as well. It was the perfect setting to relax, socialize and reflect with each other about the trip so far.\\n\\n  \\nI booked this tour with: [https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61566391001075](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61566391001075)', 'link_flair_text': 'Travel/Du lịch', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'over_18': False, 'is_self': True, 'distinguished': None, 'stickied': False, 'locked': False, 'external_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1ixqm91/day_12_hoi_an_part_2/', 'created_utc': '2025-02-25T08:54:11'}\n",
