We live in a central europe country and have the B2 licence for driving a car. This comes with a AM licence, and an A1 only for our country, but these are internal laws and its not written on the back of the licence, as its not valid outside of our country.

I've read that there's no problem in converting our licences into international ones and then getting the Vietnamese conversion from there. My problem is that I cannot really find rentable 50cc scooters. Local companies rent as the smallest a 110cc. This means that legally we cannot find anything we can drive. Are the rules in vietnam so that with a AM licence you can only go up to 50cc as well? is there a way to use our B2 or AM licence to skip the written test and just do a practical one to get the A1 vietnamese licence in a short time frame that would allow us to get going in a couple days ? 

I know we can all risk it and just pay out way out of every situation, I'd just like to not visit a Vietnamese prison if someone bumps into me and dies.

I have been dating this girl through thick and thin. I am a 26M and she is 22F. We met when we worked as waiters for a local restaurant. She and I have been living together ever since. There were a lot of issues as well as conflicts in our relationship, we had a no contact period (that lasted for 2-3 weeks) about 4 months ago and she was secretly hanging out with her ex everynight in his car. But she swore they are just friends and she is lonely. Since then there has been no issues with our relationship. About 3 months ago she informed me that her mom and brother (her dad passed away) wanted her to do a Greencard marriage for some guy in Vietnam. Note that her brother already sold a Greencard marriage once, and her best friend also sold a Greencard marriage - so this is very favorly advocated to her. When she informed me of this I told her absolutely not. 

Fast forward to Feb 7th. She told me she needed to fly back to Vietnam immedietly because her teeth hurts (insurance doesnt cover dentals here in the States). I was surprised but I didnt say anything other than help her pack her things. We did the usual couple promise like ""never breakup when were apart etc."" As soon as she landed in Vietnam, she stopped answering my texts and my calls. She only called me at night and said shes too tired to talk. This goes on for a whole week until I said whats going on, why are you evading me and the sorts. Then she hit me with the ""lets take a break until I get back to the states."" I was furious because I could feel like something is happening but I just dont know what it is. In an anger fit I said ""if you wanted to stop so bad lets just break up"" and she said ""ok."" I texted her within the night that Im sorry and please call me back when you feel better. She seen my message and then we lost all contacts. All calls unanswered all messages delivered and not seen. Even on Valentines day she was still MIA. Yesterday I gathered all my friends and we did a lot of digging on facebook and found out she got married (a whole wedding with two families and a husband). Im lost for words. Her family knows me and they know that she lives with me basically. She and I have been inseperable ever since we met, so there wasnt a chance that she has been seeing this guy behind my back. But as of now the wedding happened. Seeing her in a beautiful wedding dress smiling while holding another guys hand for marriage just killed me. Her entire family blocked me on facebook and she is still MIA. What is the play here or am I cooked?

I must disclose that the moment it gets hot I am team short shorts, thin tank tops, flip flops. No necessity of extra tissue covering my body that is already sweating profusely. 
In my native city, Barcelona, this hardly warrants a stare. I have noticed than in other places people would innerly judge but whatever, they were trying to repress it. 

So as much as I really have liked Vietnamese attitude in general, this country is a festival of how much can everyone express with facial expressions and how longer can they stare at something 😂 From the lady at the coffee store that takes my order doing a head-to-toes look, prepares the coffee while looking and smiling and hands the coffee with a second fully body check folllwed by a smirk, to a group of teenagers opening the eyes, signaling to me and then laughing out loud, to a full restaurant of women looking at me with a smile and no blink for 5-10s. I usually look back and smile, or reproduce the same they did, pointing at them and laughing, etc. But I don't want to offend anyone, and I am starting to think it is on me. On the other hand, it is 33C and 65% humidity right now in HCMC. Why add more warmth to what there is. I might be imagining things, and the clothing might not be the issue. But I am not imagining everyone staring and smiling forever, specially since they are so not subtle about it.
Travelling solo and the last month I felt like all eyes are on me for so long 😅 it starts to feel intimidating. Did anyone have the same impression? Am I exaggerating?

I asked this subreddit a while ago about hitting up 3 cities in a week, and most people who commented said just do HCMC and Hanoi, I won’t have time for anything else. But I got greedy and squeezed in Da Nang/Hoi An…. And honestly that was the best decision for me and my husband!

We are currently in Hanoi, 7th day in Vietnam (we will be leaving Saturday, so 9 days total). Counting the traveling times, we technically have 6 days ish which is wayyyy too little to really see this beautiful country. So, I decided to give up visiting Ha Long Bay. Makes me a little sad but leaves something for us to do the next time we come (and yes there was no direct flight from the US and yes it did take us 24hrs to travel but it was totally worth it) and I wanted to really enjoy the rich culture in Hanoi.

Anyways the reason I say squeezing Da Nang/Hoi An in was the best decision is the following:
1. Cooler weather, but hot enough to enjoy the beach
2. Hoi An was sooo touristy but hey, where can I see something like that in the US?
3. We had one of the BEST EXPERIENCES through a super private nature tour in Da Nang.

Honestly, that tour alone made the difference because after experiencing Mekong Delta River tour in HCMC, my husband almost had a heatstroke (outside all day, AC stopped working well on the bus ride back) and I felt extremely bad that I put him through a generic tour that caused him to get that sick. Da Nang’s temperature and the beach alone made him feel a whole lot better but I wanted to make up for the terrible experience and signed up for more nature-focused tour as he’s a super nature/animal lover. And I think I had a better experience than him honestly lol 

I am a ball of anxiety so when it started raining right before the tour started (and mind you, this was a motorbike tour and I’ve never been on one!) I starter panicking really bad and thought about canceling it. But the guides assured me and I’m glad I listened to them. We saw sooooo many monkeys BECAUSE it rained!

I would definitely come back to Vietnam just for the food alone hehe So when we come back, I would love to do more water activities like snorkeling and scuba diving so we can see more ocean life🪸❤️ Please recommend any areas for those activities!!!

I’m looking for advice on how to visit the Cai Beo fishing village (or any other similar villages) in Cat Ba Bay without joining a tourist cruise. My goal is to experience the daily life of local fishermen, document their work and traditions through photography, and simply observe, without disturbing or interfering.

The problem is that everything I find online is just tourist cruises full of people. I’ve also contacted some homestays in Cat Ba, but they all offer only standard boat tours costing around 700k-800k VND, which is not what I’m looking for.

Ideally, I’d love to:

- Find a local fisherman or family who could take me on their boat for a few hours (not a full-day cruise) and of course pay them.

- Avoid mainstream tourist activities and just focus on authentic daily life.

Does anyone know if this is possible? How could I approach local fishermen for this? Any tips or contacts would be greatly appreciated!

We'll be in Phong Nha 2 nights (10 & 11 April), but want to spend the final day there as well before setting off to Hanoi. We have booked a hotel in Hanoi for 13 April. 

These are the options I'm considering:

1- book another night in Phong Nha and get a flight from Dong Hoi on 13th

2 -book a hotel for 12th in Dong Hoi and get flight on 13th


3- get the overnight train from Dong Hoi on 12th

4 -get an overnight bus on 12th

option 1 is probably the easist, but not sure 3 nights in Phong Nha is warranted, 

i've heard there's not much to do or see in Dong Hoi, but we would be getting there in there Saturday evening so not looking to fill a day, just go out get a meal and a few drinks

overnight train kind of appeals, but we are already getting the train up from Da Nang, so we would have already ticked a train journey off

So I want to post this for y’all to have a better understanding of Vietnam. 

I travelled more than 15 times to Vietnam to visit my family who are still here. Most of these “vacations” I stayed more than a month. These are my observations that I want you to gain some perspectives.

1. You can’t expect Japan or Korea level of excursions and basics. Vietnam war ended in 1975 and it wasn’t until 1980s that the northerners came down to unify the country. My dad and uncles are only in their 50s and early 60s and they lived through it. I am technically the first generation of modern Vietnamese. The stories they tell… food rationing, tire rubber sandals, spotty electricity, leaky roofs… it was a tough time. In perspective, Vietnam has only been an independent country for less than 50 years. The civil infrastructure is not there and the governing body is made of old “war heroes”. If you take that into perspective, you may find Vietnam is excelling faster than our neighbors who gained independency in the 1940s including Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines… Thailand’s monarchy is another story).  This is the most significant perspective when traveling in Vietnam. 
2. You can’t travel in Vietnam without seeing trash and pollutions. Don’t get me started on the noise pollution (honking at 5 am) and the restroom situations (it is terrible even for a male). It is something I have accepted and worked around. Here are some tips, stay in a hotel with good noise insulation (especially in Saigon) and go to a superstore (vincom, coop mart, go…) for public restrooms and bring your own toilet papers everywhere. 
3. Viet people are rude when working, but very friendly at dinners (this applies to mostly the service sector). The culture here is work hard so you can party hard. A lot of people are in the lower class and this shows in the ways they interact in businesses. “Tell me what you need or get out of here”. “Buy my stuff or get out of here”. Some might even curse at you if you refuse their kind actings to lure you into their store. This is why you find a lot of businesses open at 7 am and closes around 5 pm. Just to point out if you haven’t noticed that Vietnamese people drink mostly light beers with ice.

I don’t want this to become an extended travel guide so I will stop here. If this gets a lot of attention then I will continue part 2. Hopefully,  you will read this and travel through Vietnam with a different perspective than most foreigners who think this is a budget vacation destination. The future is bright and hopefully you will be surprised with the changes once you revisit. ",False,False,0.91,"","2025-02-19 04:38:00","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Based on what OP said, his gym center offered free training. I guess it had a limited specific time to get free workout, but he didn't show it or hide it with purpose. The white dude came in a wrong time and get refused.

I don't know the story, and kicking the sign is definitely wrong. But since I don't know what happened, I think the OP intentionally hid the details so that Vietnamese people would focus on insulting the white guy. And in fact, the comments are mostly insulting him.

My friend recently told me that she needed $80k USD ASAP. Apparently, a family member in Vietnam created a fake title for her childhood home and got a loan from the bank against the home. He has now defaulted on the loan. She believes she can sell the home for $300k (A developer has been buying up property in that neighborhood, and they…or someone…told her that if she sells, they can close in a week for $300k).  Problem is no one knows where the real title is. She is in the US. Her sister from New York is in Vietnam right now trying to facilitate all this. She needs $80k to pay the bank loan and then the bank will be able to create a new title(?)!  I said I needed more info. Like any paperwork from the bank or the builder. She says she can’t provide it. That business in Vietnam is done differently. 

I only understand business in the US. I would expect that if you lose a title, you go to some government office and pay for a new copy. She told me they can’t get the government involved or she would end up having to bribe an official?

The oasis is hidden within rugged and lush landscapes. The group spent a relaxing couple hours swimming, picnicking and jumping into the natural pools. It’s certainly a great way to end the Ha Giang Loop tour before making our drive back to Ha Giang city. This stop was much appreciated after 4 days on the back of the motorbike, as we got another chance to unwind and loosen the legs from all the sitting.



As we rode back to Ha Giang city, the group enjoyed one last chance to relish the beauty of the rugged landscapes. Once back, we were able to explore the city a bit on the motorbikes. We stopped and got some bun cha (grilled meat served with noodles, veggie alongside a big bowl of sweet tangy sauce) and a cup of Ha Giang roasted ca phe sua da (iced coffee with milk) before heading back to the hotel to freshen up.



We now have a long journey ahead of us. At 7 PM, the group boards a VIP sleeper bus to Hai Phong city before hopping on a ferry to Cat Ba Island. The total journey time will be 12 hours including the ferry and a shorter bus ride. I’ve never sat on a bus so long before so this will be a first. Thankfully I’ll be asleep for a majority of the time. 



In the morning, we woke up to take a short ferry to Cat Ba Island, followed by a short bus ride to Cat Ba town. Cat Ba town is an underdeveloped resort town on Cat Ba Island. There’s not much going on here, which is my type of place to travel. A far cry from the one year I visited Nha Trang. A touristic city that comes off as a playground for thousands of Russians looking to escape the cold every year. Here you’ll find waterfront restaurants and cafes with several hotels lining the strip.



Cat Ba Island itself houses Cat Ba National Park and is the perfect backdrop for adventurers and nature enthusiasts to explore. Exploring the island will yield you limestone hills, lush vegetation and pristine beaches. Along the hiking trail, there were numerous viewpoints to stop at for rest and to relish the natural sceneries. However, our real destination was summiting Ngu Lam Peak, the highest point in Cat Ba island which provides panoramic views of the island and the surrounding area. Be careful hiking here, as the path goes from paved to eventually rocky and steep. It was only a short hike of around 45 minutes each way. During the trek through the park, we were lucky to catch some cool wildlife including various birds and (with our guides binoculars) the ever elusive Cat Ba Langur, an endangered primate species with beautiful golden fur.



In the afternoon we visited Cannon Fort for an excursion into the military history of the island. We saw remnants of war bunkers and tunnels set to the backdrop of stunning bay views. We then went to Hospital Cave, a hideaway in a mountain set up by the Chinese and Vietnamese to protect the Viet Cong and injured from American bombing during the war. All in all, it was a fun and informative trip before making our way to Cat Co 2 beach to enjoy the alluring tropical sunset.



When we returned to Cat Ba town, the group unwinded at Cat Ba Oasis Bar for a night of food and drinks before heading to the night market for an evening stroll. All in all, it was a fun, easygoing day. Tomorrow we head out to sea at Lan Ha Bay for a nice change of scenery.

I’m in Vietnam right now and hoping to do a 6-8 day tour of North Vietnam in early March. It seems easier than trying to plan to go to Ninh Binh, Sapa and Ha Long Bay on my own. I had a few tours narrowed down, but then read online there’s a lot of fake tour companies that run off with your money. How do I know which ones are reputable and real? Are there any reputable companies with good pricing?

I heard Sinh Tourist is useful but that there’s a lot of fake sites, and even fake stores. How do you tell which is real? Would it be better to book through third party sites like Get Your Guide and Trip Advisor? (Though I’ve mainly seen short course tours on there)

Here are the ones I was looking at:

My boyfriend and I are going to Vietnam in December if this year, staying until the start of January (21 days total). 
We are looking for recommendations! 
Firstly, we land in Hanoi, and would love to not spend all of our time going from one spot to another, but rather working our way down (or up) a smaller area to enjoy, relax but also experience. 

We’re thinking about keeping it between Hanoi and Hoi An area wise.

Thus far we know we want to stay a bit in Da Nang. We thought we wanted to stay in Hoi An as well but reading about the very stressful purchase pressure there we are rethinking. I however would love to have a few pieces tailored as I’m rarely one that fits into regular shop sizes. 

So we have the following questions:
• Are there tailors to be recommended that reside in Da Nang? Or should I go with Hoi An? Any specific recommendations? 
• We are curious about Hue, Ninh Binh, Dong Hoi - any tips or recommendations on this? 
• We are also thinking about the Cham islands - has anyone stayed there also? What was it like?

Our breakfast for the day is banh cuon, rice flour rolls with a delicious filling of either egg or pork. In most of Vietnam, banh cuon is generally served with a side dipping sauce of sweet fish sauce. However, banh cuon is served differently in Ha Giang, where it is enjoyed with a bowl of bone broth soup on the side. It’s a popular breakfast that's meant to keep you warm in the northern mountain climates. 

As soon as we leave Dong Van, the road's elevation gets higher and higher as we ascend the Ma Pi Leng Pass. Before I know it, the group is now riding on roads stretching over the side of mountains. This is the highest we’ve been since riding the Ha Giang Loop. The panoramic views here are stunning, the breeze is pleasant and all I can see is my fellow travelers taking pictures and videos on the back of the EZ driver bikes. It’s a beautiful stretch of road that left me in awe. We stop every so often on the side of the road to enjoy the views of the Nho Que river and distant mountain ranges.

Eventually we reach a rest stop with a coffee shop and access to what’s known as the Sky Path. It’s a pathway that runs parallel above the Ma Pi Leng Pass. The group parks their bikes at the rest point, grabs a cup of sweet Ha Giang coffee, freshens up and we start our short trek. The pathway can get narrow at times so I had to keep my wits about me. Regardless, it feels nice to be closer to nature and not have to sit on the back of the motorbike. Along the way we relish the sweeping views of the Tu San Canyon and the Nho Que River. The views are of course gorgeous but admittedly not too different from what you see riding the pass below. During the trek, we encounter numerous interesting rock formations and also the Ma Pi Leng Eye, a great photo op. It’s a perfectly round hole formed out the side of the mountain, giving you a peak at the pass and the views below. The whole trek took about 2 hours with the return trip.

After the Sky Walk, we rode the final stretch of the Ma Pi Leng Pass. At the end of the pass, we had the opportunity to go down to the Nho Que River. The road down was steep and narrow so the EZ driver had to drive carefully. We reached a small local village before we boarded a boat to cruise the waterways. It’s a nice change of scenery from the rugged landscapes experienced while riding the loop. The river is a beautiful dark emerald color and I felt engulfed by the towering mountains on both sides. It did start to rain at this point, so most of the group got wet. 

After the hour long boat ride, we made our way to Meo Vac town to refuel for lunch. It’s a small humble rural town and the surroundings were quite beautiful. We found a small restaurant here serving com lam: rice cooked in a bamboo tube, served either with grilled fish or pork with stir fried veggies. It’s a simple meal but greatly appreciated after the physically active morning. There's a big morning market that opens every Sunday here but unfortunately we arrived on a weekday. So we made our way towards Du Gia village, a peaceful and unspoiled gem found along the loop. 

Du Gia is located in a peaceful valley full of rice terraces where we encountered ethnic tribes going about their daily lives. As the group walked through the village, we saw many locals dressed in their traditional clothing and the traditional stilt houses made by the Tay ethnic group. I can tell there were several other different tribes living in the area due to the differences in their clothing. Regardless of the language barrier, we were always greeted with warm smiles. The group ended up staying at a friendly homestay owned by Tay hosts and their families. Of course we had a family style dinner with a side of the “happy water” that we've grown accustomed to. This will be our last night in Ha Giang, which has been a blast so far!

My name is Charles, I’m 30 years old, I’m French, and i’m thinking about traveling for 3 months in south east Asia, including Vietnam.

I have T1 diabetes, using omnipod 5 system that I charge with rapid insulin (Novorapid, or its generic name “Aspart Insulin”).
I will bring with me my pump system, as well as a small stock of insulin. Problem is: insulin has to remain cold, or it gets bad after 30 days. I wonder how I will keep everything cold enough… 

As I think it’s not possible to keep 3 months worth of insulin cold all the time, I’m thinking about buying some insulin there. 

Does anyone know : 
- If a prescription is needed, how to get one? Is it easy? 
- How much is an insulin pen?

I'm going to Vietnam as an exchange student for the last year of my Master's ( 2 semesters).

September is going to arrive really fast so I'm trying to plan ahead and organise my budget for the year to come.

I know that it cannot be preclisely estimated, because of all the factors that are to be taken into account (eating out nights, rent, trips in surrounding countries ?). But, what can be done is an estimation! Knowing that I would be staying at HCMV, studying at the USSH !

So I was wondering if someone had a price range, of roughly the amount they spent during their year in Vietnam. 

I was aiming for 10 000€, this amount would be used to buy the plane tickets, pay the rent, and as spending money for the year. Do you think it would be enough?

Having a part-time job sounds complicated knowing that I only speak English and French, so I'm trying to plan it as if I wasn't going to have one.

This rice porridge filled with pork, eggs and veggies is considered the soul food of the Hmong tribe. It’s got a bitter taste but is believed to have healing properties to the locals. Not the greatest tasting thing I’ve tried in Vietnam, but certainly worth a try. 

With our stomachs full, it was now time to head off to Pho Bang town, a tranquil and charming town hidden amongst forests. This was definitely an off-the-beaten-path destination compared to other stops in Ha Giang. The road here was stunning and dreamy with different colored flowers in bloom. The town moves at a slow pace and the centuries old houses will had me  transported to another time.

After our little visit, we made our way to Tham Ma Pass, my EZ driver's favorite road in all of the loop. When we got there, I understood why. It’s a beautiful and serene windy road surrounded by lush vegetation all around. Once we reached the top of the pass, there’s a nice rest stop with a coffee shop. There’s also a small stall run by a Hmong lady selling candy, grilled meats and desserts. Hmong children dressed in their traditional garbs were running around playing soccer and braiding hair. I grabbed some sweet mayflower roasted coffee and sat and admired the view of motorcycles driving along the pass. 

After Tham Ma we headed off to Sung La Valley where we passed through small villages and vibrant flower fields. The mayflower hadn’t bloomed yet so I can only imagine how much more beautiful it is in season. Riding the Chinh Khoanh pass there and back was quite the exhilarating drive as I counted 8 or 9 hairpin turns.

After the detour to Sung La Valley, we made our way to the Hmong King’s palace. This was the former home of the area’s Hmong Kings, a rich family that brought peace and prosperity to the region. They were able to do this by working with the colonial French government and then the Viet Minh led by Ho Chi Minh all while running an opium running business. Crazy stuff. Walking around the palace grounds, I could tell the property was well built in its time. Most of the original architecture and furniture was still intact. I enjoyed the architecture which was a blend of Chinese and European styles.

After the small history detour, the group made its way to the Lung Cu Flag Tower, the most northern part of the Ha Giang Loop. At the top of the flag tower, there were panoramic views of ethnic villages and you can even see the Chinese border as well. 

The roads leading to and leaving the Lung Cu Flag Tower was drenched in a red clay like mud. The roads were slippery here and you definitely have to be careful riding. I saw a couple travelers on a motorbike wipe out here. Thankfully they were driving slowly so it didn’t seem too bad.

Our final destination of the day was Dong Van town, a common stop when driving the loop. I can tell the town has been affected by the rise in tourism in recent years. Big hotels sprung up with tons of travelers out and about. The town center preserves its cultural heritage with well maintained wooden buildings from centuries past. The center was beautifully lit by lights and many businesses like restaurants, gift shops and massage shops were opened.

The group had dinner at one of the restaurants on the main strip. The meal of the night was black chicken hotpot, a soul warming family style meal. This is a Hmong specialty and is absolutely delicious. The plump chicken is served alongside fresh vegetables, mushrooms and noodles ready to be cooked in a steaming pot of soup at the center of the table. It’s a fun meal to share with family or friends. We also enjoyed the meal with “healthy” amounts of happy water, or rice wine.

After the meal, we walked around the strip where there’s a few lively bars that double as homestays. Big groups of travelers fill these bars. Our group ended up at Linh pub where there was karaoke night. So we heard everything from Vietnamese songs to Backstreet Boys and more. It’s a fun way to end the night off with the group. The tipsy journey home was easy as our homestay was literally a few minutes walk away.

This post is for you.

 

As you may know, Vietnam is still largely a cash-based society, though in recent years, it has been trying to become less dependent on cash. The HCMC subway is a prime example. I tested the system myself and these are the payment methods that I found that they accepted.

 

1. Cash: As of the time of writing this post, cash can only be used to buy paper tickets at every station's ticket counter. There are ticket vending machines, but they are not operating atm, state media said those machines are estimated to be in service around May of 2025.

2. Momo: This is for those who have Vietnamese bank accounts and are registered with the Momo app. On the app, it will generate a QR code for you to scan at the fare gate. Offered 1,000 VND discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

3. Bank transfer: Apply to purchase a single-time ticket at the counter, for those who have a Vietnamese bank account only. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

4. Napas card: This is the domestic card system of Vietnam, the latest network to be implemented on Saigon Tap to pay the fare gate. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

5. Visa card: Visa cards (debit and credit whether issued inside or outside Vietnam) are not accepted for tap-to-pay at the fare gate like the New York OMNY system yet. But a Visa card can be used to purchase a single ticket at the counter. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

·       Tested using BofA Travel Rewards card Apple Pay and Truist visa physical card NFC.

6. Mastercard: Mastercard (debit and credit whether issued inside or outside Vietnam) with NFC function can be used for tapping to pay at the fare gate, works well with physical cards, MC linked to Google Pay and Apple Pay. The catch is that there is no system to check the travel history of your card yet. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

·       Tested using Apple card and Vietnam bank Mastercard credit via Google Pay and chip.

7. JCB: cannot be used for Tap to pay at the gate, only for purchasing tickets at the counter. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

·       Tested using Vietnam bank JCB credit physical card both NFC and chip.

8. Discover: cannot be used for Tap to pay at the gate, Tested with Discover It card using Apple Pay, and credit card terminal at the ticket counter displayed as card not supported. Will test with a Discover physical card to be sure.

9. American Express:  cannot be used for Tap to pay at the gate, only for purchasing tickets at the counter. Offered 1,000 VND fare discount (4 cents USD) if paid with this method.

·       Tested using Amex Hilton Honors card and Green Card, with Chip, NFC, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

10. UnionPay, MIR: unfortunately, I do not possess any UnionPay or MIR card ATM, but it should be accepted at the ticket counter.

 

Types of tickets, where to purchase:

1.      Single journey ticket:

· At the counter of each station: You will receive a slip with a QR code printed on it to scan for entrance and are required to keep that slip to exit at your destination station. The slip has no English language translation so, if you want to know what it said, ask some random Vietnamese around for help. Sometimes the staff at the fare gate will take your slip when you exit. If that happens, relax, it’s nothing serious. But if you can keep it, consider it a souvenir.

Almost all payment methods described above can be used to purchase a single journey ticket and you will receive a 1,000 VND discount for **NOT** paying in cash.

· On the HCMC metro app: I’m not an app person so I do not know how to buy tickets on the apps, but I do know they accept Visa, Mastercard, and JCB as payment methods.

2.      Day pass, 3-day pass, monthly pass: As of today, these passes can only be purchased through the HCMC metro app, not at the ticket counter. Needless to say what about those ticket vending machines?

Will be in the region soon and want to run up and down Fansipan. I see there is a guard booth and entrance fee. Have zero issue supporting the national parks system financially!! Happy to pay my fees. 

I also have read a guide is forced on you. Has anyone ever been able to demonstrate that they are capable and have all experience, gear, and emergency rescue GPS (INREACH for example) in case something dire happens, and allowed to head up without a guide? 

Secondly..... Can I take the cable car up and run back down the trail from the top without a guide? What is the situation at the top of the trail? 

Alternatively, anyone know what will happen if the guide simply can't keep up with my pace? Can I drop him and and meet him back at the gate? 🤭

Lastly, I will be starting late morning. Probably 10a or 11a on a weekday, to give the crowds time to dissipate and trails a chance to dry up a bit from the morning dew. Maybe this will help me as all guides will be gone? Just pay the fee and head up.

This is my first trip to Vietnam.

I just noticed that Ninh Binh seems like a decent option for a 1 day trip from Hanoi. Not expensive either. I like to visit scenic places but am not fond of beaches etc. And coming from Thailand, I would love to be in a some what cooler environment.

Can someone please spare a few minutes and help me find answers to the following questions.

1. Are the late evening/night views really mesmerizing in Ha Long Bay making the night cruise a must have experience? or am I better headed back to hanoi in the evening as part of a day trip?
2. Most visitors who have visited Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh seem to mention that Ninh Binh was really nice, even better than Ha Long Bay. Do you concur?
3. Will it be totally sunny and burning hot all day in the above two places?
4. Is Ninh Binh a little cooler as compared to Ha Long Bay or at least offers some shady touristic spots?
5. Is the sun world cable ride or some other attraction really worth it while in Ha Long Bay (i can stay the night if required but somehow have not not noticed anything that would catch my fancy - caves and beaches are not my cuppa tea) ?

Hey! My boyfriend and I will be going to Sa Pa but have around a week before we need to be there so we’re looking for a place or multiple places to visit before then. We’re currently in Hanoi and would like to find places along the way to Sa Pa, ideally nothing requiring a long detour. We don’t like the typical British tourist party vibe and are looking for something more authentic but maybe not tooo remote (not sure). 

While in Sa Pa we plan on staying at a remote home stay while doing treks and enjoying the nature so would be nice if for the week leading up to it, we do something slightly different. 

I know many recommend the Ha Giang loop but we’re doing it in April so that’s off the table. We would also like to avoid doing anything too chilly as it is end of February so not too warm.

I find it strange that the police in Vietnam don’t specifically target foreigners, given that many of them drive without a license.

The reasoning goes like this:
	•	The police are corrupt, and bribery is common.
	•	Vietnamese people are very money-driven.
	•	Scams are widespread in Vietnam.
	•	Tourists have little power when dealing with authorities.
	•	500,000 VND (about $20) is a significant amount of money.

Since all of these points are true, I don’t understand why the police don’t just stop every foreigner they see on a motorbike, ask for a license, and take a bribe if they don’t have one. Or, they could accuse them of speeding without evidence, knowing that tourists can’t argue and would rather just pay the fine.

I’ve heard this is common practice in Phuket, but oddly, not so much in Vietnam, despite its strong money-driven culture. Even in Hanoi, I saw plenty of foreigners riding bikes without issue. Maybe there’s an unofficial policy to leave foreigners alone in tourist hotspots like Da Nang, but even in Hanoi, foreign riders weren’t being constantly pulled over.

It’s baffling. Given the corruption and financial incentives, you’d expect the police to be stopping foreigners all the time for easy bribes. But instead, they only seem to pull people over when they actually break the law—just like in a developed country. It doesn’t add up. 

FYI- I havent seen any foreigner be pulled over in my entire six weeks in da Nang!",False,False,0.54,"","2025-02-15 15:43:42","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

* **Budget:** $1000 per person (this includes flights from **Delhi to Vietnam** and **Thailand to Delhi** at the end).
* **Time constraint:** I have between **10 to 15 days** to do this.
* Might be traveling with a friend—if we can sync our schedules, probably after or in **May,2025.**

# What I Need Help With

1. **Is my budget even realistic?**
   * We don’t need luxury—just the essentials and a good experience.
   * Not looking to survive purely on street food, but we also don’t plan on fine dining.
2. **Is 10 to 15 days enough to explore everything from Hanoi to Phuket?**
   * What should I cut or prioritize?
3. **Itinerary suggestions?**
   * What’s the best route to follow?
   * Should I skip some places to make the trip more enjoyable?
4. **Pro-tips and Big Bro advice?**
   * Budget hacks, transportation tricks, or things I should know before I go.
5. **Fun & Lesser-Known Places**
   * Hidden gems that aren’t packed with tourists but are still worth checking out.

I took my tour with Garden Villa in Ha Giang and these are my highlights.

VIP Sleeper Bus – 6 hours overnight. First time experience riding one of these. It was quite comfy and it wasn't too hard falling asleep. We were let out mid way through the journey for a washroom break and quick snack.

Garden Villa – A quaint homestay on the edge of Ha Giang town. Friendly hosts with a big motorcycle collection for rent to ride on the Ha Giang Loop. We were served a nice family style breakfast alongside tea and coffee. The rooms are small yet cozy. It’s also located by a river so you can get some awesome views. 

Ha Giang City – Nice small yet bustling town. If I can get the chance, I’d want to explore it more. We had to drive 15 minutes from one end to the other to reach the start of the Ha Giang Loop.

EZ Drivers – Best way to ride the Ha Giang Loop if you don’t have your driver's permit. You’ll be on the back of a professional driver, who knows the loop by heart.

Police checkpoints – Was told by my driver that a ticket costs about 2,000,000 VND or $80 USD a day. Some travelers will eat the fee just for the thrill of driving a motorbike. 

Bac Sum Pass – Twisty and windy roads, through mountain passes. The roads are beautiful here with great scenery all around.

Quan Ba Heaven’s Gate – Panoramic mountain views with endless rice fields and rolling hills in the distance. This was where I began to understand the appeal of the Ha Giang Loop. There’s a coffee shop at the summit where you can enjoy some Ha Giang mayflower coffee. It was so delicious!

Twin Mountains / Fair Bosom Mountains – On further inspection, it does look like a set of bosoms. Perfectly symmetrical. Nature is beautiful. The EZ riders brought us to a rest stop with a perfect view of the Twin mountains.

Roadside stalls – You’ll see many along the loop, selling grilled meats, fruits and drinks. They’re nice places to stretch, relax and fuel up.

Ethnic tribes people – Along the way I saw many ethnic tribes people going about their days. Whether it’s running the roadside stalls or walking along the roadside with their days work on their backs. You’ll recognize them right away by their distinctive garbs.

Lang Khuy Cave – A small detour from the main road. You’ll have to do a short trek before reaching the cave. Expect to see stalactite formations, unique rock structures and ponds within. It was nice to stretch my legs after a day of riding the back of a motorbike.

Pine forests – A pretty cool sight to see in tropical Vietnam. The forests keep you cool during the ride.

Yen Minh – Small quaint town with a population of primarily of ethnic tribes. There’s a morning market here where you can see various tribes converge to trade and sell their specialty wares. Each tribe will have their distinctive clothing.

Thang Co – Horse stew, a local Hmong specialty. It has a strong gamey taste that is offset by the many spices that flavor the dish. Not something I’d yearn for again but it was certainly worth a try. We got to enjoy it with rounds of “happy water” or rice wine, which helped wash down the flavor.

For context - our child was 1.5 years old during this trip and we traveled from early December to early February.

Thailand

1. Stroller vs carrier - both are okay but I’d personally recommend a baby carrier. Sidewalks are all over the place (read: uneven, not always there etc.), so it’s a lot of hassle with a stroller. With that said, you can’t really let the kid walk by himself on the sidewalks, so mostly have to carry him.

2. Kids stuff - diapers available in every 7-11 which are like every 200 meters or so. All the pharmacies we went to had at least 1 person speaking English well, so no issues there to get eye drops or whatever.

3. Traveling between cities - buses 100%. Granted, we haven’t tried 1st class trains, but those with open windows (probably so called ‘fan only’) are crazy loud and really not meant for toddlers. Now buses on the other hand are very frequent, so it was quite convenient picking the right time to travel. Do note - you still want to buy tickets for most locations a day in advance, since they can be sold out quite frequently (we had issues with Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai, Khao Yai to Bangkok). Do not use vans/mini buses if you can avoid them - vans have close to no leg room so good luck with a squirming toddler. Mini buses shake like crazy - the food will be upsetting your child’s stomach enough, no need to add extra.

4. National parks - we only visited Khao Yai, but afterwards ditched all plans for any other nature visits. While the park was beautiful and everything, it’s really not for going with a toddler. All the beauty lies in trekking. For context we hired a car for a full day. Normally, they told us, this would include 2-3 trails. We were able to do only one short trail before the driver told us that this is clearly not working out - we were taking far too much time.

5. Random locals will straight up drop whatever they’re doing to come up to your child - they will chat with them, touch them, try to hold them. That’s completely normal.

Vietnam

1. Stroller vs carrier - stroller isn’t even a consideration. Sidewalks in Vietnam exist for motorcycle parking, not pedestrians. I am quite convinced Vietnam has some sort of hidden agenda to rid their country of pedestrians. Carrier only.

2. Kids stuff - similar experience with pharmacies, however diapers weren’t as available in mini markets. In Ho Chi Minh ended up walking to a specific shop recommended by a pseudo tourist information center and buying the smallest bag available which lasted us close to a month, so can’t comment more on this haha.

3. Traveling between cities - night buses are really nice and comfortable. No need for an extra seat for your child - can comfortably fit an adult+toddler in one. Neither me, nor my wife, nor our child are small by any standards and we still found it good enough (for context I’m 190cm and 100kg).

4. Phu Quoc seems to receive a lot of hate on Reddit, but when traveling with a toddler - I’d say it’s just touristy enough. Plenty of restaurants, cleaned up beaches with enough bars for refreshments.

5. Ho Chi Minh - air quality was unbearable. Adding on top the incense they burn everywhere (I think?) and it was way too much for us.

6. Traveling around their New Year’s - we left just before it (26th or so of February), so only will mention 1 thing - Vietnamese burn a lot of stuff right before their New Year’s. You can literally walk out of your 4 star hotel and there will be a bucket burning all sorts of papers and plastics in the middle of the day. It’s not a one-off - it was happening across a few cities we were in during those last few days.

7. Vietnamese airlines - we took I think in total 3 flights and every one of them was delayed by at least 1 hour. Keep that in mind when planning your snacks - prices in airports easily rival those of most Western countries.",False,False,0.85,"","2025-02-14 19:50:48","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Even tho I'm a mid to long-termer, I'm still staying in hostels as the social opportunities are quite good, which allowed me to meet locals and like-minded people in Japan and Taiwan.  
  
I'd like to do the same in VietNam but am unsure where to stay mid to long-term and I'd probably switch it up a few times. It's not my first time in VietNam as I did backpack it the first time but very fast in a month.  
  
I'm currently in SaiGon, but it's honestly very overwhelming as the city is super fast-paced, very spread out and most hostels are in D1. Also travelers there are often here for the crazy party scene and getting fucked up. While I don't mind drinking, it's not was necessarily leads to more meaningful connections even tho sometimes it can. I don't mind sipping a beer and having deeper talks too.  
  
I'm also nearing the end of my 20s so I sometimes feel a bit disconnected from the people still in their teens or beginning of their 20s. Taiwan's average age was much higher, which is probably attributed to the higher cost.  
  
I'm pretty sure that I'll stay longer in the Da Nang/Hoi An area and want to visit Da Lat the first time too. I heard so much good about Da Lat but never went there so far.

We had a dedicated waiter for lunch, dinner, and brunch (sort of, more on that in a minute). Before checkout he came to our room to settle our drink tab (which was $0) and we tipped 500,000 VND cash.  We thought our family would tip at their settlement but they thought we were covering everything so they gave 0.

At checkout, we also tipped 500,000 VND cash to the crew bowl.

We read beforehand that there isn't tipping culture in Vietnam but it may be customary to tip $2-4 per person per day, 200,000 VND per room per night, etc. so we thought 1,000,000 VND was a decent tip.  That said, when we discovered our family didn't tip, I planned to give an additional 500,000 VND.

However, our waiter never came around during brunch.  Everyone else's waiter was attentive, taking pictures, etc. We saw him helping other guests but he avoided us like the plague. It was a complete 180 to the service provided the night before and we collectively felt he was mad at us.  Now I feel like we under-tipped but in a way it is his fault for his reaction.  He could've gotten twice the tip by simply taking a drink order at brunch and we could have addressed the miscommunication. Overall, it is a bit unsettling and we welcome any input.

Edit: trying to avoid more hateful comments I want to reiterate that we did research cruise tipping culture in VN because the cruise mentioned tipping at time of booking. The price of the cruise was only mentioned as a frame of reference for tipping % and not a flex. We did not tip in any other situation on the trip and know it is not customary elsewhere.  We were taken aback by the waiter's actions and the consensus is that he was in the wrong.  His actions are a sign of how tipping culture can be bad.  Thank you to everyone defending me against the angry commenters. Thank you to those who recognize tourism can be good for an economy when done right and respectfully. Thank you to those who recognize how the cruiseline created this situation in the first place.

My motives are that I’d love to be able to experience the culture in Vietnam, while also still being able to pursue something I’m passionate about which is supporting children.

I’m just wondering if anyone here has heard of the Catalyst 4 Change program before, how it is viewed by possibly locals or others, or even if there are other organisations out there that offer similar opportunities that are supportive of supporting local teachers, supporting children and other education based fields.

I'm traveling to Vietnam with my partner in June 2025 and have somewhat decided on the general lines of my itinerary, but would love some suggestions on possible changes.

I realize the itinerary is probably very packed, but we'd really love to see as much as we can, as we're planning on dedicating future travels to other countries in Asia and only after returning to the countries we've been to.

We are arriving and leaving from Hanoi and staying for 16,5 days (arriving early morning, leaving at beggining of night).

I plan on doing some of the local trips by plane and some by bus/train, (Sa Pa, Halong Bay, Ninh Binh and Hoi An).

This is my planned itinerary:

\- Hanoi - 2 days and a half (2 days in the beggining, half a day at the end of the trip);

\- Sa Pa - 2 days (travel by night via bus);

\- Halong Bay - 1 day (one full day and night, leaving the morning after to go to Ninh Binh);

\- Ninh Binh - 2 days (by bus/car via Halong Bay);

\- Hoi An - 2 days (probably via plane from Hanoi or sleeper train);

\- Nha Trang - 3 days (or other beach destination);

\- Ho Chi Min - 2 days (by plane or train and flying back to Hanoi).

  
As you can see, from my 16,5 days in Vietnam, I only accounted for 14,5 days.  
  
I had originally planned on visiting Hue and Da Nang (had fewer days in Ninh Binh and Hoi An to allow this), but after some consideration, I believe it would probably be worth to drop both of these in order to add more days in my other destinations.

If I was to indeed drop Hue and Da Nang, I would probably add 1 day in Sa Pa and 1 day in Nha Trang, or add additional days to the big cities, but I'd love some opinions.

Also, Nha Trang seems like my choice for beach destination (weather probably won't be great in Phu Quoc and Cat Ba Island in June and Quy Non seems more dificult to get to), but I'd also appreciate if you have a better suggestion.

Finally, what would you change, namely, add any places, remove any places or simply stay for a shorter/longer period.

Thanks in advance!",False,False,0.5,"","2025-02-13 17:35:51","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Ninh Binh is known as Ha Long Bay on Land for the towering karsts and gorgeous countryside scenery. I much enjoyed this whole trip as it was a nice getaway from the bustling Hanoi. This was part of an itinerary with a tour company.

VIP Limousine to Trang An – A nice way to travel, comfy and plush seats with tons of leg room. I definitely felt like a VIP.

Hoa Lu Ancient Town – Interesting history involving two Vietnamese dynasties. Lots of ancient yet well preserved architecture can be found here. The town was specially located to defend from foreign invaders in the past. If you’re a history or architect buff, this will be the spot for you as you walk amongst 1000 year old buildings.

Cycling the countryside – A fun yet relaxing activity in the countryside. Rice paddies, friendly farmers, the simple life.

Trang An boat ride – A serene boat ride through lush lands, winding waterways and limestone caves. It was nice to sit back and enjoy after a morning of cycling. You sit in a traditional sampan boat while the rower rows with her feet. Yes, her feet. The scenery during the 2 and a half ride is gorgeous.

Mua Cave – It's a small hike of 500 steps to get to the top of the viewpoint. The breeze is nice and the views are something else. Our group captured a nice set of photos from the top of sampan boats moving through waterways surrounded by rice paddies.

After the trip, we went back in Hanoi for dinner:

Bo La Lot – A Vietnamese specialty with grilled meats wrapped in betel leaf served alongside rice paper, veggies, herbs and a peanut dipping sauce. Roll it all up, dip it in the peanut sauce and it's scrumptious. I enjoyed this at “Quan Nem lui Ba Trai” in the Old Quarters.

In 1980 and 1986, two treaties were signed between East Germany and Vietnam, whereby East Germany provided the necessary equipment and machinery for production, increased the area of coffee plantations from 600 to 8,600 hectares (1,500 to 21,300 acres), and trained the local population in cultivation techniques.

In particular, East Germany provided trucks, machinery, and irrigation systems for the newly founded Kombinat Việt-Đức, as well as spending approximately $20 million on a hydropower plant. East Germany also built housing, hospitals, and shops for the 10,000 people who were relocated to the area for coffee production. Against this investment, East Germany was scheduled to receive half of the coffee harvest for the next 20 years. However, coffee takes eight years from planting until the first usable harvest, which occurred in 1990; at which point the East German state had already ceased to exist.

My name is Kevin. I am 22 years old, from Germany, and currently working on my high school diploma (Abitur). As part of our school curriculum, I am preparing a research presentation that I will subsequently present to my class and teachers. The topic of my presentation is: **""Vietnam War Veterans – Physical and Psychological Strains.""**

In this context, I would like to explore the situation of veterans after the Vietnam War. This includes their reintegration into society, coping with physical and psychological injuries, as well as the general challenges they faced upon returning home.

To deepen my research and make the topic more authentic, I would very much appreciate the opportunity to conduct a short interview with a Vietnam War veteran. It would not involve an extensive discussion but rather just two or three questions, which I would like to include in my presentation either as a video or in written form. I am aware that the chances of finding someone are relatively slim, but I hope nonetheless that someone might know a veteran or be related to one who would be willing to speak with me. If a personal interview is not possible, I would also be happy to receive written responses to the questions.

If you or someone in your family is interested in participating in such an interview, I kindly ask you to reach out to me. I would be extremely grateful for your support!

Thank you very much in advance to everyone who takes the time to read this message and possibly share it further.

* Using Grab to get around (Imperial City + Dong Ba Market + Thien Mu Pagoda // Mausoleum of Emperor Minh Mang // Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh // Mausoleum of Emperor Tu Duc)

I don’t really mind the cold but since we nearly always rent a scooter to drive around in the countryside, It would be bad to do all those steps under the rain with big clouds hiding the mountain view.
Is it worth going to all those places ? or should I focus more on 2/3 steps and stay longer in each one ? I’m kinda lost…

**Day 1: Arrival in Hanoi**

I made it. After 16 hours of flight time (14 from Vancouver, plus a quick 2 hours from Hong Kong), I’ve finally touched down in Hanoi. Every year I plan a solo trip of two to three weeks with just me, my backpack and a sense of wanderlust. This year with a busy work schedule and with a little extra cash, I decided to book a 3 week itinerary from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, all set up by Epic Adventures Vietnam. It’ll be nice not having to deal with any travel planning for the first time. The trip is set in stone and all I have to do is enjoy the journey.



I step out into Noi Bai terminal, a compact yet modern international airport about 30 KMs away from Hanoi. I walk by a line of gift and noodle shops, tempting me with the first taste of Vietnam. I reach the arrivals area of the airport and immediately I’m met with the humidity of Hanoi. A smile fills my face, I’m happy to be here in the tropics once again. I walk by a line of people with signs, I see a friendly Vietnamese fellow with a sign that reads Epic Adventures in big red letters. That’s my ride! I joined a group of about 10 or 11 people—all excited for the days ahead. We quickly board a shuttle and reach our stay for the night: the elegant Bonjour Hanoi Hotel. It’s an early night and we have a day full of activities planned for us tomorrow.  



Early in the morning at 8 AM, our group guide, Minh Nguyen—a friendly Vietnamese man who always had a grin on his face, greeted our group of 10 people. He gave us a quick introduction before going over the history of the Old Quarters where our hotel was located. He said we’d be having breakfast at his favourite bún chả spot. As we strolled over to the restaurant, he gave more interesting tidbits about the Old Quarters. Immediately the group was enthralled by the tube (thin yet highly built) houses that line the streets. We finally arrived at Ô Bún Chả and we’re immediately greeted with the aroma of grilled meats in the air. It smells fantastic. Our group is seated at a long table. Our dishes quickly arrive and each of us were met with a steaming bowl of smoked meats in a fragrant sauce served alongside vermicelli, fresh lettuce and herbs. Minh, our ever friendly guide told us to dip the veggies and noodles into the sauce and to chow it down with the delicious grilled meats. This might just be my new favorite dish in Vietnam!



After our hearty breakfast, our guide walks us around the Old Quarters some more. We’re led by beer street in the Old Quarters and told we’d end our night here. It’s not busy but I wonder what the night will look like. We finally reached our next destination, Linh Coffee—a cozy open air coffee shop on the side of a road in the Old Quarter. We’re all recommended to try an Egg Coffee, a Hanoi specialty. My coffee arrived with a custardy yellow foam at the top. I take my first sip and wow it’s delicious. Creamy egg yolk with hints of sweetness and the robustness of Vietnamese coffee melding together certainly hits the spot. My day has now officially started.



Our next destination of the day is visiting Uncle Ho, the revered communist leader of Vietnam who passed away in 1969. Today you can find him at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. His body is embalmed in a glass case for thousands of visitors to pay respects to every day. Once you’re there, you can truly feel the high regard and respect that the locals have for this man. His body, perfectly preserved and displayed in a solemn setting. To see it in person is a truly surreal experience. I remember thinking: wow, this man is responsible for the modern Vietnam of today. The history and the significance of the man is lying all there for me to see in person. Definitely a surreal yet humbling experience. 



After the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, our next stop is the Temple of Literature, also known as the first university complex of Vietnam founded in 1070 by Emperor Ly Thang Tong. Until the colonial period, it had been open for over 700 years and educated hundreds of renowned scholars and mandarins. Visiting here, I immediately felt the grandeur, serenity and historical importance of the place. It was pretty cool walking around the grounds where students and scholars used to stroll many centuries ago. I’ve got to admit, it was well preserved for such an old establishment. There are five courtyards here, all representing different meanings and significance. My favorite courtyard was the one with the massive square pond.  It’s hard to describe the beauty of the place, so here are some pictures for you to see. 



After visiting the two places, it was finally time for some food. I was feeling hungry from all the walking. There was no need to board Epic Adventure’s shuttle bus, instead the group walked on over to “Pho Bo Huong Hieu”. As soon as I arrive, I can smell the aroma of pho in the air. I’m excited, this will be my first bowl of pho in Vietnam in years. The pho of Northern Vietnam is fragrant and quite different from the pho served in the south of Vietnam. You’ll find a lighter broth served with tons of green onions. I slurped down the bowl in a matter of minutes—it was that good. 



After lunch, our group was given the freedom to explore Hanoi on our leisure. I’m not going to lie, 16 hours of flights is pretty tiring, so I joined the shuttle back to the hotel for a quick nap.



Hours later, my phone rings, I answer and hear “Hi Mr. Tom, your jeep tour is waiting for you downstairs”. I sprung up, got dressed and made my way downstairs. Several big green military jeeps line the streets. The inner child in me is beaming. We hop in the back of the jeeps with our groups and now rumble through the streets of Hanoi. So far it’s my favorite experience since landing in Hanoi. The jeeps are open-air and I can feel the wind brushing against my hair while the sounds of the city ring all around. We make several stops including the opera house, a couple bridges and street food stops. One of the nicest parts of the journey was the peaceful ride around Hoan Kiem Lake. The streets are filled with motorcycles as happy families roam around the lakes. Our second last stop is the Hanoi Train Street where we get out and sit on tiny stools and tables right by the railroad tracks. I order a lemon iced tea and hear a train coming in the distance. I sit nervously as a train whizzes by. I swear it felt inches from my knees. Finally, our jeep tour concludes and our jeeps drop us off at our last stop: Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre.



There’s a busy crowd out front of the theatre. We collect our tickets from Minh and saunter over to our assigned seating. As the theatre fills up, the group goes over the day’s activities and their favorite highlights. The jeep tour was the clear favorite among us. The lights turn off and the stage lights up. We’re greeted by a colorful group of puppets floating and gliding across water. This was much better than I thought it was going to be. The music, the lights, the dancing puppets—it was a mesmerizing display. I can tell the group was drawn and in awe. After about 45 minutes, the show concludes and we’re now given freedom to roam Hanoi on our own.



Our guide and the group decide to go for some Bia Hanoi’s on some tiny stools in what is known as Beer Corner. It’s a nice, fun yet wild setting to end the day along with some people watching and a tipsy conversation with new friends. 24 hours ago I was in my home city of Vancouver and today I’m buzzed with a Bia Hanoi in Hanoi, Vietnam—I’m elated to be here. After about an hour of back and forth mingling, the streets are packed, people are literally squeezing right beside us and the air is filled with energy. Some of us decide to stick around and venture out into the night. I decide to hit the hay and head back to the hotel to relax for another day of fun.



A huge shoutout to Epic Adventures Vietnam for making my first day in Hanoi unforgettable! From street food to jeep rides, history to late-night beers—this is just the start of an epic journey. Stay tuned for day 2!

Hi everyone! Our family is traveling to Vietnam in August 2025, and we’re looking for the perfect beach destination for a few days of relaxation between Dalat and Hoi An. We’d love your recommendations!

🏖️ What We’re Looking For:

✔ Calm, swimmable waters – Safe for kids, not too rough or wavy.
✔ Walkable beachfront restaurants & shops – We don’t want to be stuck eating only resort food.
✔ Relaxed, quiet atmosphere – No big crowds, nightlife, or party scene.
✔ A bit of local charm – Prefer a place with some authenticity (not just big resorts).
✔ Reasonable access from Dalat – Since this is a midpoint between Dalat and Hoi An, we’d love a beach that makes sense logistically.

🚫 What We Want to Avoid:

❌ Overly isolated resorts – We want easy access to local food & shops.
❌ Heavy nightlife or party spots – We prefer a peaceful setting.
❌ Beaches with strong currents or rough waves – Safety is a priority.

🏝️ Destinations We’ve Considered:
	•	Bai Xep (Quy Nhon) – Quiet, local charm, beachfront restaurants, swimmable beach.
	•	Ninh Chu (Phan Rang) – Undiscovered, good local food, shortest trip from Dalat.
	•	Tuy Hoa (Phu Yen) – Hidden gem, great scenery, relaxed vibe.
	•	Mui Ne – More touristy, rougher waves, good food options.
	•	Cam Ranh – Resorts, swimmable beach, but more isolated.

We’d love to hear firsthand experiences from travelers who’ve visited these areas or have other hidden gem suggestions that fit our needs!

✈️ Our Itinerary for Context:

📍 Singapore (2 Nights) – Stopover for city fun & attractions.
✈️ Fly to Ho Chi Minh City

📍 Ho Chi Minh City (1 Night) – Food, markets & culture.
✈️ Fly to Dalat

📍 Dalat (2–3 Nights) – Cool mountain retreat, waterfalls, night market, coffee culture.
🚗 Travel to a beach destination (TBD) before Hoi An

📍 Beach Destination (4–6 Nights) – Looking for the best fit based on recommendations!

📍 Hoi An (5–6 Nights) – Ancient town, beach time, lantern festival.
🚗 Drive or train to Da Nang

📍 Da Nang (2–3 Nights) – Ba Na Hills, Marble Mountains, city & beach balance.
✈️ Fly to Singapore for departure.

Would love any input from those who have traveled these areas! Thanks in advance! 😊🏝️

(Dân trí) – Belarusian wrestler Zakhar Dzmitrychenka has taken the internet by storm after lifting and throwing down his Japanese opponent, Masafumi Arikawa, at the Triều Khúc village wrestling festival (Thanh Trì, Hanoi).

At the beginning of the year, traditional wrestling arenas across Vietnam become lively once again, especially in the northern region. Notable festivals include those in Mai Động, Tây Đằng, Quan Âm, and Ngô Sài.

# International Presence in Vietnam’s Traditional Wrestling

For a long time, these wrestling arenas have grown beyond local scale, attracting renowned wrestlers from across the country, such as Đào Hồng Sơn and Hà Văn Hiếu.

More recently, international wrestlers have also begun showing interest in Vietnam’s traditional wrestling. They participate in traditional attire, perform ceremonial rituals, and compete under the rules of the national wrestling style.

The presence of wrestlers from South Africa, Germany, France, and the United States has added a fresh dynamic to traditional wrestling festivals. The latest example is Belarusian wrestler Zakhar Dzmitrychenka, who faced off against Japanese opponent Masafumi Arikawa at the Triều Khúc village festival on February 8.

Dzmitrychenka displayed clear dominance over his opponent, effortlessly lifting and throwing Arikawa to the ground. His celebration quickly went viral on social media, bringing even more attention to Vietnam’s traditional wrestling scene.

Many viewers expressed excitement at seeing Vietnam’s village festivals gaining international recognition. Social media users hope the wrestling events will attract more athletes from around the world to promote Vietnamese culture.

# Accomplished Wrestler with Global Experience

Zakhar Dzmitrychenka has previously won a bronze medal in the World Greco-Roman Wrestling Championship and holds the title of Master of Sports in wrestling in Belarus.

He also competed in the MMA LION Championship 19 event in Phú Quốc in November 2024, where he dominated Vietnamese fighter Trần Quốc Toản in the 84kg weight category.

It's hilarious.  
  
I have been a translator and the ""de facto"" tour guide for many international friends. Their favorite dishes are rarely ever the popular ones. They like the randomest things like cabbage soup (canh bắp cải), a nameless sticky rice snack on the street, kẹo dừa (coconut toffee), cơm gà xối mỡ, canh khổ qua (the fuck?) and one of my close friend was so obsessed with rau má (pennyworth) he tried to smuggle some out of the country (did not work, for obvious reasons).  
  
When a young Vietnamese person goes out for dinner, they will think Korean BBQ, fried chicken, Chinese hotpot, Japanese ramen. You will never see a friendly get together without boxes of pizza laying around. And let's not pretend that McDonalds aren't absolutely packed at 7PM every night with Vietnamese families. Those same people will unironically go online and leave comments about how Phở is the best food in the world.  
  
So in short, don't let fanatics shame you for not enjoying Phở. Don't mind their B.S when they spam about Bánh Mì on every post about burgers or sandwiches.

I use Android while my SO uses Iphone.

When sharing the location link in Grab to Whatsapp, Android fetches the link and opens the Contact dialogue in Whatsapp. The user can then edit the message before sending. 

On iPhone, I discovered that it provides the send button in the iOS UI where the user selects where to share the link with, without switching/opening Whatsapp, the screen remains on the Grab App. This causes the issue that, if Whatsapp has not been used recently (not actively running in the background), it does not send out the message immediately. Instead, the user has to actively open Whatsapp in order for the outbound message to be triggered resulting in an unnecessary extra step (that often gets forgotten)...

To keep it short, I'm fairly certain I left it on the floor while rearranging my luggage at Ho Chi Minh City airport and forgot to pick it up. I returned to the airport's Lost & Found two and three days after losing it, but they hadn’t found anything. It's now been almost a month, and I've lost hope of finding it.

I reported the loss at the nearest police station and have the police report.

To leave Vietnam, I contacted my embassy (located in Hanoi, while I'm in Ho Chi Minh City). They said they would issue me a ""Return Certificate"" ([details here](https://www.mfa.am/en/return-certificate-to-ra)) and suggested sending it via DHL to avoid traveling to Hanoi.

However, I've read online that a Return Certificate alone might not be enough to leave the country — many sources say I need an ""exit visa.""

I visited the Immigration Department in Ho Chi Minh City, and they told me I need:

* A replacement passport
* The police report
* A document from my embassy confirming my passport was lost

When I told this to my embassy, they seemed surprised. They said they’ve sent many people back home without needing an exit visa — just the Return Certificate.

I’m really confused and would appreciate advice from anyone who's been through a similar situation.

1. **Is it possible to leave Vietnam with just the Return Certificate, without an exit visa?**
2. **Can it be a problem that the main document I have will be a Return Certificate rather than a replacement passport.**
3. **If I want to play it safe and get the exit visa, but my embassy isn’t familiar with the process, where can I find the document template required by immigration?** If I will have some form, I can ask my embassy to fill it out, sign it, and then use that document along with the police report and Return Certificate to get the exit visa. Even if there's no specific form, I would be grateful if someone who went through this process could share the document they used (feel free to DM me).

I'm not concerned anymore about searching for my passport at police stations — even if someone found it and returned it to a police office, I doubt they would make much effort to locate me, even though I provided my address when applying for the e-visa. I just want clarity on how to navigate this situation and safely return home.

Thanks in advance for any help!

She's not a teacher, however she is supposed to be working for a company and then they will sponsor her visa.

First they said things will be slow because immigration had paperwork overload. Then they said the Tet holiday and Lunar New Year will slow down the process. Three weeks ago they said the visa was done and now we have to wait for the approval letter and she will need to go to the Vietnamese Embassy. Now they're saying that she doesn't need to go to the embassy, she will get the letter end of next week.

To be frank, I think she's getting scammed. She lived in Vietnam before but her visa expired and she left. This person who owns the company is her boyfriend's friend and married to a Vietnamese.

In 2019, my oldest sister (35F, who managed my bank account at the time) siphoned the money I earned from my CS internship towards my sister (23F), and it caused a vocal altercation through phone that strained our relationships for good. Due to the fact both my sister and I (23F, 23M) both live in the same city, within a mile from each other, she has been actively tormenting me and it caused my college GPA to plummet, from a 4.8/4.5 to something like a 4.2/5.

I have not been in Vietnam for Tet since 2006 (I spent my formative years with my uncle (89) and aunt (87) in Russia between 2006-12 and then the US since 2012) and I have always been curious what Tet looks like in Vietnam, so I decided to visit Vietnam for Tet this year. Due to the fact most amenities are closed during the morning of 29 January, I decided to meet my parents, of which they both invited me to their house at 8 am, and they promised to li xi me 10 million VND. I decided to take the Grab to their house, and arrived at their house in Binh Duong.

At around 8:30 am on that day, AKA after about 40 minutes at my parents house, I felt like I regretted my time there heavily and wished that I'd stay at HCMC where there is a McDonalds in Da Kao just a 5 min walk away from my hotel accommodation. Even though my father is generally nice and is willing to speak English (unfortunately, I lost command of Vietnamese due to CPTSD caused by my maternal family, but could speak French, German, and Russian), my mother is very hovering/controlling towards me and it made me feel uncomfortable. Add into the drama, my sister (23F) was also vacationing in Vietnam at the time, and even though my parents welcomed me into their accommodation (I left at noon), my sister started going to war with me and even though I remained calm, she was irrationally violent towards me and not only hit me, but threatened to call police, claiming SA. Ironically, I had no idea my sister was in Vietnam as I had next to zero communication with her since 2019, and my parents told me that my sister is still in the US at a medical school.

Luckily, my parents silenced her, and they took me with them to a restaurant, and then around Thu Dau Mot on their Volvo. After we returned home at 11:30, my parents coerced me to stay, but I escaped by booking a Grab, and then I returned to HCMC at 13:00, where I stayed at my hotel and visited the Chua Ngoc Hoang.

Now the reason for all this mess was due to an altercation 5 years ago:

Due to the fact my paternal relatives are affluent/influential, and communists, they are being perceived as the 'black sheep' and 'scapegoats' in my mother's family. My maternal relatives also espouse traditionalistic views and are apathetic towards elite institutions. For example, they heavily practise filial piety and hair dye/tattoos are off limits in the family.

I have a friend who was born in April 2000, and in 2004, when he was 4 years old, he was diagnosed with autism. Funnily enough, his parents immigrated to the US and live in the same city as my mother's American relatives. Even though he is gifted/talented and independent from his family since 17, my mother's family and his family have a bad perception of him, mainly due to his diagnosis. His education was severely hampered by his parents, mainly due to their ableistic perceptions on him, and hence, he was never able to realize his full potential even though he could have attended a HYPSM university if his parents gave him the correct education opportunities as a child (mind you, his parents are also doctors). Due to the fact I am his closest friend and my personality traits mirror him, my mother's side assume I have autism (undiagnosed), and therefore, I have been viewed as a black sheep since 2013.

During high school, my unweighted GPA was very close to 4.0 (my weighted GPA was much higher given the fact I took many AP courses and post-AP courses such as Multivariable Calculus/Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Discrete Maths, CS 2, etc) and I received a 1550 on the SAT (800M, 750V) as well as an 800 on two SAT subject tests (Math II, Physics). I even competed in the USAMO and ISEF and had two CS internships in Summer of 2017 and 2018.

Even though I have achieved a lot during my childhood years and adolescence and was contemplating about starting a tech startup, my mother's side showed more affection towards my sister (23F) who dreamt of becoming a general practitioner and went to a university with a >80% acceptance rate (in the same city as me). They gave her more warmth, they talked in a nicer and friendlier tone towards her, and they even praised her, whilst my achievements were mostly ignored and instead, I was castigated during family gatherings and at worse, even ostracised. My older cousins sometimes even engaged in corporal punishment if I didn't socialise with the whole family and I am obviously weak at social skills myself. 

That made me feel jealous because even though my father and mother helped fund for my schooling, they as well as the whole of the mother's side collectively funded her lifestyle and gave her perks and affection. In fact, in 2014, during 9th grade, my maternal relatives attempted to tell my parents to withhold my tuition money and send me to a worse private school and siphon that money towards her so she could get freebies as well as attend some school like Philips Andover whilst also buying a condo/single house for her due to her 'respecting the family more' and 'knowing how to speak their language'.

We attended the same high school and we lived with our older sister (34F) in a 2000 sqft house.

In 2019, things did take a turn for the worse. I was still under 18 in summer of 2019 so I couldn't invest the money nor have a bank account of my own, but needless to say, I bought a safe to stockpile all the money I earned through internships, YouTube revenue, and mobile app revenue at the time, so my bank would typically have amounts in the low thousands for immediate purchases. Needless to say, in July 2019, due to the fact my 34F sister is still in charge of my bank account, I saw that my balance went down from $6000 to $1000. I essentially lost $5000 of my own money and guess what:

All of the money went to my 23F sister.

In August, I found out the whole family pooled in money and used my money to buy her a $700k condo in the poshest neighbourhood (even moreso than mine which is a college neighbourhood) and they also bought her a brand new 2019 BMW 330xi as well as pooled in money for her EB5 visa.

Due to this, I became jealous at her. Unfortunately, I didn't have a therapist at the time, so I ended up so infuriated I essentially had a vocal altercation with her on the phone that went a little bit too far that my sister decided that she will go NC against me and 'lost her trust' on me. In retaliation, I went NC with everyone in my family, except my parents because I kinda rely on them for financial support as I just started to make in the mid 5 figures per year on my software. In September 2019, I started my own bank account, sold the safe, and stockpiled my money into the bank, where I funneled in all of it towards investments. By 2021, I sacked them and was 100% self reliant, and frugal (that meant I didn't move to any luxe-apartments nor did I buy any car and instead used a $250 Walmart bike to commute).

Even though everything was harmonious between 2019-20 with me coexisting with her in the same city, things started to go out of control in 2020 that made my undergraduate GPA plummet, from a 4.8 in 2018-19 to a 4.6 in 2020 (remote year), and then to a 4.0 in 2021 (first in person year).

Turns out, even though I have no idea of my sisters whereabouts whether she is in Asia or in the US as it was COVID, turns out police knocked on my apartment door and gave me a warning that my sister reported me to them for ""stalking"" at her college (had no idea where she studied and I was minding my own business and did not go to her college). That was what caused a heated altercation with my relatives. I told my relatives to calm my sister down, apologise for my supposed 'wrongdoing' and asked them to let her know I did nothing wrong and that I was minding my own business.

In 2020, she travelled to Asia and my parents sold that condo in September 2020, so I had no idea where she lived as my parents own multiple multi-family and single family units throughout the metropolitan area.

That made me paranoid, wanting to transfer out to another university in another state but feared upon losing my place at a top tier university, and it caused me to have trauma and sleepless nights and disinterest in studying which was what caused my GPA to plummet. It is so fascinating that my mother's family who obviously support her tell me they have nothing to do with her and they can't control her life and they just essentially let her free roam like this, which was what harmed my life. They even gaslit me, making claims that she is 'stubborn', 'a tough girl', etc, and that she won't listen because she came from wealthy family, and spread misinformation that children of impoverished parents are better behaved and more compassionate.

I know my sister very well as we were classmates at high school and she is known to volunteer and help other people out, mentor, and offer therapy/counseling to marginalised/neurodivergent people, even if her grades/SATs weren't as stellar as mine and she took less AP courses than me.

In 2021, I essentially returned to campus so depressed that I essentially lacked any support as I had no therapists or psychiatrists, and my GPA plummeted big time. Even though I had an internship, a research fellowship, led a campus club, and held awards, etc, during 1st and 2nd year, I was heavily demotivated in the 2021-2 school year and all I wanted to do was graduate. After graduating, I took a small 1 week Europe trip to Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, Bratislava, and Prague, and went back to just a deep several month rest. I did eventually get hold of a therapist and actually got a relatives RAV4 in the beginning of 2023 whilst they buy a Tesla Model Y for themselves and just driven around the East Coast for some relaxation.

Between 2019 and mid-2023 when my sister graduated from university and my parents visited US for the first time since COVID, I had no contact with her whatsoever. I didn't have any idea what neighbourhood or town she lived between 2020 and 2023, let alone the house. Now even though May 2023 was the only time since 2019 when I did talk to her, apologising to her for the 2019 incident, establishing boundaries, and ameliorating the relationship, she claimed she is traumatised by my actions, had sleepless nights, and had to resort to therapist. She ended up using profanity in front of me as well.

Later, one of my cousins told me that my sister was featured on the student spotlight on the front page of the school, despite the fact my family gaslighted me telling me she is a low achiever and struggled in college. I also found out on YouTube watching her school graduation that she graduated summa cum laude (3.9/4.0) and held an internship in Healthcare and now is hired full time in that position. I was immensely betrayed. It's so baffling my family let my GPA slide whilst my sister essentially got full support even from extended family and is uplifted.

I then attended a private school for 6 years before attending uni, where I majored in EECS in 2018.

I could speak multiple languages, including English, French, German, and Russian, and despite understanding Vietnamese as I lived in Vietnam between 2001-6, I could not speak Vietnamese, mainly due to trauma from family as my parents (75M, 64F) treated my sister (23F) far better than me. She was viewed as a golden child and my family siphoned the money I made from my internship towards her back in 2019. My boomer relatives insulted me with Vietnamese words and was verbally abusive, which led to me being traumatised. That led to an altercation via phone which led to her cutting off from me. Due to this, I don't want my relatives to utter a word in Vietnamese due to the trauma and instead, preferred to be silent with many of them. They pitted me against my less talented, but golden child sister, who then tormented my life (tldr).

Luckily, my father (75M) could converse in English and Russian quite proficiently as he studied in the USSR between 1968-74 for a medical degree and in Czechoslovakia between 1974-6 for a masters in public health. He is a Healthcare dignitary in Vietnam, and he would typically respond to me in English, despite the fact his Russian is better due to the fact he lived in North Vietnam from when he was born until he was 18 in 1968.

My mother (64F), who studied at a medical school in HCMC, could not speak any English so I started either using sign language or speaking with either my father or two older sisters (35F, 23F) and letting them translate.

Between 23 January and 4 February, I visited Vietnam, and my mother pressured me to speak Vietnamese and I don't really feel comfortable speaking or even listening to them in Vietnamese, mainly due to familial trauma. My mother even claimed that I am disrespecting Vietnamese people if I don't speak Vietnamese.

I am 1000% fine hearing other people speak Vietnamese, especially outsiders, but due to family drama, I wanted to refrain as much communication with family as possible. I am even fine watching Vietnamese videos and can read and write Vietnamese (despite living abroad for 19 years).

An interaction with my older cousin (51M) was the turning point in me wanting to listen to my family in Vietnamese:

Despite the fact my 51M cousin knew I don't want to speak Vietnamese, in 2015, there was an incident where my cousin (41 at the time) took both my sisters (25 and 14 at the time) and I (14 at the tims) from Boston to NYC and for 4 hours straight, he has been nagging me to speak Vietnamese. I was in the front passenger seat of his Subaru and a fun fact was that he got a bachelors degree from an American university so his English had to at least be ok.

One phrase he said was:

Mày phải nói được tiếng Việt nếu không tau sẽ đỗ xe và bỏ mày lại bên đường highway.

You have to speak Vietnamese and if not, then I will leave you in the middle of the highway.

Yes, I was being serious. He did nearly stop the car in the middle of the motorway and forced me our of his car and stranded. But luckily, I did have an iPhone 6 at the time so I might be able to call CPS as well as an Uber.

I told him there is no way I could only speak Vietnamese to the family and that my sisters both understand and could articulate English words fluently. In fact, my oldest sister is an OBGYN doctor in New Jersey and my second sister studied molecular biology in Boston and interned at a prestigious research lab before attending a medical school so not only could they decipher ""big"" words, they even know some medical terms of which I might not even know because I received an SB in EECS.

Something like this went on for hours until I finally got him to silence after arriving in NYC. My mother claimed that my cousin was just ""joking"" but it seemed to have intimidated me and I still saved the translation for my therapist.

My cousin (51M) insulted me in a condescending voice whilst at the very same time, he talked in an affectionate and soothing tone towards my sisters.

Also, let me mention that despite not being diagnosed with ASD/ADHD, etc, I do heavily believe I am neurodivergent because I am socially reserved and have been since childhood and also, I do come out as a ""nerd/geek"" and my characteristics are unconventional compared to your typical social extrovert. I am also a high achiever in all/mostly advanced classes especially during my formative K-12 years, and I do have a friend whose got similar personality attributes to me who was diagnosed as ASD/Aspergers.

Due to this, I only use the translator when talking to Vietnamese people or even speak English entirely, which made people think I am either Chinese, or American.",False,False,0.82,"","2025-02-09 04:57:13","2025-02-09 17:57:23"

The pollution: the traffic jam and the pollution in VN is terrible. As much as I love my SG city, but it still drained all my joy anytime I had to go out. It got to the point I even missed how peacefully I drove in the US and how unbothered I am when I drive. It's just too much happening on these busy SG street that I couldn't enjoy like I used to.

The people: I love my people and always will be, but sometimes people are just in your business too much and I realized how peaceful living in the US when everyone is just minding their business and unbothered they are.

I know there are a few people that has gone back to VN and settled there successfully and love the life there as well. I am just wondering if any of those people had some similar thoughts like this and if yes, how do you guys cope with it.

This is my third time in Hanoi, and I haven't been here since before COVID. I remember that it used to be easy to bargain in the downtown shops, but now, with the increase in tourism, prices remain quite stable—you can only lower them by a few VD. 

My impression is that tourists just pay whatever price they are asked, and these prices are quite inflated compared to what I’ve seen elsewhere or on Lazada and Shopee. For example, North Face backpacks on these platforms are priced at 250-380, whereas in stores, they don’t sell them for less than 500-550. I’ve tried bargaining, but they don’t accept lower offers because they know another tourist will come and pay that price.

Since I can’t order online because I don’t have enough time to receive the package, my question is: does anyone know of a store that offers fair prices?

Growing up my Grandmother was a very integerol roll of my life. I just didn't know it until it was to late.

She was always trying to show me where I came from.  What the other half of my DNA was about. But I shut it down because I was young, stupid and easily influenced. I wanted to be like my friends. 

This will be one of the biggest regrets of my life. 

I traveled to Cà Mau the other day. The family from her side still resides in the same location as always for quite a few decades. I had never met these people before in my life. Yes we were technically family, but with all due respect: we were strangers. 

They welcomed me with open arms and treated me with more love and compassion than I've ever experienced. We paid respects to my grandmother at her alter, then proceeded to have the best karaokee / feast of my life. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you're a halfer like me who has lost touch with the other side... Please check it out. And if you can go with your grandmother, do it for me. ",False,False,0.88,"","2025-02-08 19:53:27","2025-02-08 20:00:23"

Hundreds of thousands of people, Filipinos, Spaniards, and Americans, were massacred in awful ways by the Japanese, men, woman, children, infants, many of the buildings and places it occurred in are still here in plain site.

I stayed at this condo which was sitting on a former site of a brutal massacre where young girls were beheaded when resisting rape, baby’s bayoneted eyes gouged out , people burned alive, girls breasts cut off. You can read the brutal events here. When I was there the TV and lights would turn on by itself and I’d hear footsteps I left asap

There was so much corpses everywhere during the battle of Manila so there are unknown burial sites everywhere. The Japanese also buried many massacred groups of people.Construction firms still find bones and skeletons to this day ",False,False,0.87,"","2025-02-08 09:57:38","2025-02-08 10:30:16"

I’m looking for advice on applying for Vietnamese citizenship through my father. I was born and raised in a Nordic country, but both of my parents are Vietnamese citizens. My father now lives in Vietnam, and I want to apply for citizenship with him since it seems like the easiest route.

However, there’s a problem: The issue is that my father’s birthdate on his documents in my Nordic country doesn’t match the one on his Vietnamese documents. Because of this, they might say he is not the same person, which could make it difficult to prove my relationship to him.

  
Has anyone dealt with a similar issue? Should I skip using the birth certificate and try to prove that my father is my father through other means, like a DNA test?

On this website ([thuvienphapluat.vn](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/)), I was able to chat with some fantastic people who explained a lot to me and directed me to other resources.

From their explanations, I understood the following:

(1) **No authorization is required to transport a drone for hobbyist use** (like my DJI Mini 3 Pro) **between airports**, and no documentation is needed.
 
(2) However, authorization is required to fly a drone over Vietnamese territory, and this authorization can be requested in three ways:

 - **By sending a form by physical post mail** to the Operations Department/BTTM at the address: 1 Nguyen Tri Phuong - Ba Dinh - Hanoi
 - **By going in person** to the Operations Department/BTTM at the address: 1 Nguyen Tri Phuong - Ba Dinh - Hanoi and bringing the completed form
 - **ONLINE** (wow, finally) NO ☠️, to do it online you need to register on the Ministry of Defense's website, and you MUST be a Vietnamese citizen.

(3) So, for tourists, the only option is to send it by physical post mail (which, in my opinion, will take forever) or to go to Vietnam and deliver it in person. The consequences are that **you will have to wait 5-7 days** and then return to pick it up, and you won't know if you were granted permission or not.

(4) Cost: 0 (zero)?  Yes? idk, it costs nothing, *as it is stated on the website*. (but i don't really know because i didn't have completed the procedure.



Website for the online form: [dichvucong.mod.gov.vn](https://dichvucong.mod.gov.vn/web/bo-quoc-phong/thu-tuc-hanh-chinh#/thu-tuc-hanh-chinh/5377)  
Website for form filling instructions: [dichvucong.gov.vn](https://dichvucong.gov.vn/p/home/dvc-tthc-thu-tuc-hanh-chinh-chi-tiet.html?ma_thu_tuc=226741&open_popup=1)

An example of the form can be found in the 2011 Decree link I provided earlier. You can also find a .doc version of the form in the ""How to apply for Flycam permission"" link above, but you must first register on the site (no need to be a citizen).



So, my summary and questions are:

1. For a tourist, applying for the flight permit is only allowed via postal service by sending the proper form or delivering the form in person. Since the cost of this service and authorization is listed as 0 (zero) on the websites, I’m wondering about the phrase I found online: ""Permits range in price from $350 to $700 per day of flying."" What does this cost refer to?

*I imagined that since only citizens can apply for flight permits online, this price might be what private Vietnamese individuals charge to act as intermediaries and offer the service of submitting the flight request for foreign tourists. Or, since I couldn't complete the procedure, maybe they ask for that money when you submit the form by mail. In that case, how can they charge you if you send it by mail? I can't find a logical explanation for this.*

2. So, just to clarify, the drone can be transported at airports without issues, but to fly it, you need those permits, correct?
3. If you are reading and you have been a tourist there using your drone HOW THE F* 😂 did you asked for the permission or sended the module?

Any advice or consideration is welcome (PLEASE HELP IM DESPERATE 😭), feel free to recommend anything, I would like to be as informed as possible. Also, if you have any doubts or questions, feel free to ask them, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to respond, but I’ll do my best. I hope someone here can help me. Thanks a lot for your help! ♥️

I intend to spend 4 days between Hoi An and Da Nang from 14th Feb to 17th Feb. While I’ve never travelled alone before it’s been something I’ve been wanting to try. 
I would like to plan some hours of the day but see how I feel the rest of the time. There are many group and individual tours available online but I’m curious if anyone here has any suggestions on the good options where the host/ guide is really insightful and not just touristy. I understand that Hoi An and Da Nang are quite touristy but I would like to explore the not so obvious places. I hear there is the oldest soy sauce making family run business which I can’t find online but would like to visit. Is the beach in Hoi A worth it or given the time constraint should I stick to explore the beach life in Da Nang? 

I am inclined to history, architecture, culture and also enjoy food and a few drinks. So does anyone know of a good tour I should join for fun to meet other travellers for the night market or food tasting? Or even cycling!

Also, any other female solo travellers that would like to meet who may be around on those dates? I’m Indian, love to travel the world with my partner (who joins me after 4 days and we head up north for 3 weeks!) I am spiritually exploring avenues to consciousness, enjoy dancing, work as an ad film producer in Mumbai :)

Is it dangerous? That depends. If you know how to navigate it, you’ll be fine. Most accidents are minor, though I’ve seen a few serious ones over the years.

Is it bad? Not compared to cities like Toronto, LA, Bangkok, Tehran, Istanbul, or Mexico City. In those places, you can get stuck in gridlock for hours, moving just a few meters during rush hour. That doesn’t happen in Vietnam for the most part. When people here complain about traffic, it's almost cute.

One day, if urban planning doesn’t evolve to handle the growing population, things could change. Take Toronto, for example. Poor city planning, too much bureaucracy, and constantly shifting policies...

Hanoi, projects like Âu Cơ took forever to complete—a simple highway dragged on for years. But in Danang, they completely resurfaced Hồ Học Lãm and its sidewalks in just two weekends.

For now, be grateful that traffic isn’t worse given the population size.

My parents and I are U.S citizens while my cousins are Vietnamese citizens. I know Vietnamese citizens need to have a Japan visa for short-term stay/tourism. The earliest day we want to fly out to Japan is 2/22 if possible. I’m wondering if we have enough time to get their visas approved. They are going to apply for a visa at the Japanese embassy in Da Nang.

My question:

* Is it realistic to get visas for my 3 cousins on short notice as a group?
* One of the required documents when [applying for a single entry visa](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page23e_000538.html) is proof of financial ability to cover travel expenses:

>Documents to prove ability to pay for travel expenses  
・A certificate of income or a tax declaration certificate issued by a public agency  
・Certificate of deposit balance

Since my parents and I are covering all the expenses for this trip, how do we meet that requirement? One cousin is employed and could likely provide income documents, but the other two are still in college.

I will be landing in Ho Chi Minh City in the early morning hours (6-7am) at Saigon Airport.

After the group tour ends, I will again be spending a day by myself before returning.

I used to live in a dorm with a lot of Vietnamese students, and ultimately we ended up inviting each other for dinner quite frequently. Awesome! Never thought that a pig ear 'salad' would taste so great. 

Disclaimer, I will talk about what I got served by them, I don't know if this was genuinely Vietnamese or if that was just their style.. 

Now to my question: they served green(?) tea after the meal, a small pot which was pretty much entirely filled with tea leafs, they filled it with water and served the tea in a small cup, almost like a small shot glass, size-wise. It was strong but delicious. When I tried something like this at home with any green tea I could find, it tasted bitter and plain horrible.

Em cảm thấy bản thân giỏi, ngoại hình ổn, bản thân em thấy mình không đẹp không xấu nhưng hay được nhiều người khen về ngoại hình, tâm, tính em tốt, em chắc chắn điều đó. Chính vì vậy em cũng muốn có một anh người yêu hợp mindset và ưa nhìn. Chưa bao giờ em có ý định hạ gu mình xuống trong khi mình ổn vậy, và đó là 2 tiêu chí cơ bản nhất mà em tìm kiếm nhưng không thành. Còn hỏi tại sao em muốn kiếm người yêu ư? Em biết anh chị sẽ kiểu như bảo em mới cấp 3 thì lo học hành đi nhưng mà thật sự bản thân em luôn ý thức được việc quan trọng như thế nào nên em luôn đứng thứ hạng cao trong lớp, và em nghĩ rằng việc có một người bầu bạn, sẻ chia là một việc hết sức bình thường ạ. Em từng quen 1 người và trong khoảng thời gian đó, em cảm thấy em có thể niềm nở với mọi người hơn, tươi cười nhiều hơn, và không ru rút trong phòng như trước, em thấy rất nhiều sự tích cực khi có thể quen ai đó. Btw việc gì cũng có mặt trái của nó, em không thể tìm được ai phù hợp và em kết thúc mối tình với nyc cũng là do về sau cùng cả hai có quá nhiều điểm khác nhau và gây xích mích, cho nên em đã chuyển sang hướng khác là tìm phù hợp với mình ở nơi xa hơn, và đó là lúc em biết đến những app dating, thật sự mục đích của em khi lên đó là tìm người trò chuyện, tâm đầu ý hợp, bởi em cũng biết rằng việc kiếm người yêu qua mạng là no hope. 
Nhưng mọi chuyện bắt đầu từ đây khi em đã match được hợp cạ, bọn em có thể nói chuyện từ sáng đến tối mà không bị bí idea, quá nhiều điều khiến em thích thú từ đối phương và thế là trong chúng em đã nảy sinh một tình cảm mà cả 2 biết là không nên. Về phía anh kia, vẫn cảm thấy bình thường cho dù đứa nam, đứa bắc. Còn về phía em, không hiểu sao nhưng em luôn lo lắng về tương lai của cả 2, em cứ nghĩ rằng "" chả nhẽ cứ nhắn tin qua lại, không một cái ôm, không một cái nắm tay, mặt thì chưa thật sự thấy , cũng không biết người ta thật sự với mỗi mình không, hay sau này chán mình rồi lại đột nhiên biến mất, cũng chính bản thân mình cũng sợ mình chán và nhỡ người ta để ý một người nào đó nhưng lại bỏ qua chỉ để chọn một đứa quen qua mạng hay sao? "" v.v và mây mây, nếu như không yêu thì thôi chứ một khi yêu em luôn dành nhiều suy nghĩ cho người đó, và có khi là thức khuya chỉ để giải quyết mâu thuẫn chẳng hạn. Vì em biết cách duy nhất để duy trì mqh là tiếp tục nhắn tin và mãi mãi nhắn tin, lúc này em lại nhận ra không phải như vậy hại nhiều hơn lợi hay sao? Cũng chính vì vậy em là người chủ động rời đi, mặc dù tình thì vẫn còn và sau đó, chính em là người lụy những đoạn tin nhắn. Mà một khi đã lụy, em phải tiếp tục đi tìm một người an ủi và chia sẻ tiếp theo bởi đó là cách duy nhất em lấy lại tinh thần , cứ hứa với lòng đừng có tình cảm với người ta nhưng rồi mọi thứ vẫn diễn ra như một vòng tuần hoàn. 
Em không hay tiếp xúc với bố mẹ và trên lớp được xem là ít nói ( đương nhiên đối với bạn thân hay hợp cạ là nó nhiều hơn bình thường ), cảm thấy như ở trường sau một ngày dài tiếp thu kiến thức và chỉ hỏi han bạn bè 2 3 câu thì về đến nhà lại ru rút trong phòng bởi bố mẹ em luôn bận việc và em chỉ có thể chơi với chiếc điện thoại. Em nghĩ đó là lí do em không thể tìm được người phù hợp ngoài đời nhưng nếu quen qua mạng thì gặp phải vấn đề như trên. 
Thật sự em đang rất rối, cứ mỗi đêm xuống là y như rằng bao nhiêu chuyện về các mmc em lại ôm ra khóc và cảm thấy vô cùng cô đơn.
Thật ra ngoài đời em được khá nhiều người để ý nhưng đó không phải gu của em, gu của em toàn mấy anh trên mạng thôi hic, với cả em phải thú thật thêm là khi trên mạng em có sửa ảnh, không phải đến mức không nhận ra nhưng vẫn là sửa cho nên em cứ nghĩ mấy ảnh đến với em do nhan sắc, bản thân em cũng đòi hỏi đối phương ưa nhìn nhưng mà thật sự người ta chỉ quan tâm ngoại hình mà không thèm để ý cách em nói chuyện hay những thứ khác của em hay sao ý🥲, mà nếu có người đến với em qua cả nhan sắc và mindset thì em lại sợ khi gặp ngoài đời em không giống trên ảnh thì lại quá thiệt thòi cho người ta, cho nên tính tới nay em mập mờ chắc 4 người nhưng chưa có gặp ai ngoài đời bao giờ. Đó là câu trả lời nếu ai có hỏi tại sao em không hẹn gặp.
Em rất mong mọi người giúp em, có thể là sẽ cười em nhưng mà em cần lời khuyên thật ạ😭😭😭, em cảm ơn nếu ai đã đọc rồi ạaa❤️",False,False,0.4,"","2025-02-05 16:56:31","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

We learnt many things on the local culture and did more things than I thought it was possible to do in one day: boat on the Saigon river, scooter in the countryside, walking in the gardens, fruits tasting, alcool factory, sweet factory.

The tour is not “touristy” at all, and that’s the exactly what we were looking for! It’s more expensive than usual tours, but it’s totally worth the price.

When I read many articles on internet, most people assume that original Chinese people did not have Tết like southern people, like Bách Việt (Yue peoples), citing quote from quote by Confucious saying he doesn't know Tết, he thought it was a tradition from Yue peoples; also the early ancient Chinese people primarily cultivated millet before switching to rice, unlike the Yue peoples who cultivated rice since the start and so the conclusion was Tết belongs to Yue peoples, including ancient Vietnamese people, because Tết only originated from rice growing cultures. When I checked again from chinese source it was actually Confucious saying “子貢觀於蜡。孔子曰：「賜也樂乎？」對曰：「一國之人皆若狂，賜未知其樂也！」子曰：「百日之蜡，一日之澤，非爾所知也。張而不弛，文武弗能也；弛而不張，文武弗為也。一張一弛，文武之道也”, which translates as ""Zigong asked about the end of the year celebration, Confucious said: Do you like it? People in the nation dance like crazy. I've never felt such fun. Hundred days of working and one day to enjoy that effort. You won't know"". From this statement, it can be concluded that the Chinese New Year did indeed had a history since the foundation of ancient China, because like the Romans, who didn't even grow rice, they also celebrate new year in the time around springtime. Also, from my view, since the ancient homeland of Vietnamese people originated from Dongting Lake in China, around the time of 楚 (Chu, meaning Sở) state, Vietnamese people were probably sinicized partially, and by the time of the 1000 years of domination by Chinese we inherited so much of their culture, to the point we still have clothes designed similar to them, new year customs similar to them like giving red envelopes, burning hell money, writing chinese characters in new year time, while the only thing that makes Tết unique from Chinese New Year is the folklore of Bánh Chưng-Bánh Dày that continues to this day. My perspective is just that, I consider Tết as a fusion of ancient customs before the sinicization happens, with the customs after that, and even if foreign people say ""happy Chinese new year"" outside Vietnam, I don't find any offense, just as long as they say happy Tết or happy Vietnamese new year, or lunar new year to me (technically not actually lunar but a solar calendar based on moon cycles, and only Islamic cultures use true Lunar calendar).

Each has its own appeal, but choosing the wrong one could mean you miss out on the best experience for your taste.

As someone who has been to both, I’ll help you untangle this question by comparing the sights, activities, prices, travel times, and who’s best suited to which location.

**Too long, didn’t read? I got you, bro.**

**Short answer:**

* **Love golden rice fields, countryside vibes, and cycling? → Go to Tam Coc.**
* **Prefer stunning caves, temples, and year-round scenery? → Choose Trang An.**
* **Have time? → Do both!**

**TAM COC**

**Note:** Less crowded than Trang An but can be busy in peak season

Tam Coc is the perfect choice if you like the golden rice fields stretching along both sides of the Ngo Dong River, especially in late May - early June. During this season, the scenery is truly breathtaking, like an incredibly beautiful countryside painting. If you come outside of the rice season, the scenery is still beautiful but does not have the ""wow"" effect like when the rice is ripe.

What will you experience in Tam Coc?

✔ Take a boat through three caves: Hang Ca, Hang Hai, Hang Ba - the feeling of floating under natural stone arches is very special.

✔ The rice fields are brilliant yellow in May-June, the rice fields are green in February-March, but outside of these two seasons, it is not too outstanding.

✔ Cycle around the countryside - the road is quite flat, with fields and Mountains on both sides, very peaceful.

✔ Near Bich Dong Pagoda, you can rent a bike and cycle to the temple after finishing the boat ride.

✔ More restaurants and accommodations than Trang An, convenient for those who want to stay overnight.

Note:

Boat time: About 1.5 - 2 hours.

Ticket price: $5/person + $6/boat (maximum 2-4 people).

Fit for: Those who like countryside scenery, golden rice fields, gentle experiences and can combine cycling to explore the surroundings.

**TRANG AN**

**Crowds:** Can be very busy, especially on weekends and holidays

Trang An brings a more pristine, larger feeling with caves through the mountains, ancient temples and pagodas and clear water. If you like to explore a diverse cave system and experience many destinations along the way, Trang An is a more suitable choice.

What will you experience in Trang An?

✔ More caves than Tam Coc, longer, wider, with stops such as Sang Cave, Toi Cave, and Nau Ruou Cave.

✔ Take a boat through many temples and pagodas: Trinh Temple, Vu Lam Palace, where King Tran used to be the capital.

✔ Clear blue water, majestic mountains, the scenery does not change with the seasons, beautiful in any season.

✔ Many routes and places for trekking.

✔ More majestic mountain locations and beautiful scenery for photographers

✔ There is a kayaking service if you want to explore the river yourself instead of sitting on a boat with a rower.

Note:

Boat time: 2.5 - 3 hours, longer than Tam Coc.

Ticket price: $10/person (including boat).

Suitable for: Those who like to explore caves, have longer experiences, go boating through temples and pagodas and want a little more adventure.

# 📍 Tam Coc:

✅ To **see golden rice fields** *(go in May–August)*  
✅ Prefer a **shorter, more relaxing boat ride**  
✅ Love **cycling through villages & peaceful countryside**  
✅ Need to try cuisine **& hotel options**  
✅ You’re on a **budget**

# 📍 Trang An:

✅ Love **caves & adventure** *(more exciting, bigger caves and trekking)*  
✅ V**isit temples & historical sites**  
✅ You don’t care about **seasonal rice fields**  
✅ Deal with **a longer (2.5 – 3 hr) boat ride**  
✅ You want to try **kayaking instead of just sitting on a boat**

Our original plan was to head towards Hanoi and stop a few times on the way and then fly south.
But is the southbound trip better? 
The weather forecast looks a bit dodgy but are there many places to visit for a family like ours if we are heading south?

To  Vietnam now a total of 5x times and the more I go the more I want to stay and live there.  My wife is from Dong Nai Provence city called Long Khanh about a hour away from Saigon . My wife has a huge family and every time they see me  they greet me with open arms and don’t see me like an outsider but see me as one of their own which is honestly something emotional in the fact that they see me as part of their family and community.  Vietnamese and Mexicans are very similar in many ways and I think that’s why I connect with them and I don’t feel like outsider taking cold showers when their ain’t no hot water running lol. The motorbikes the food the people the country the cities all have something unique about them. I’ve told my wife I want to move there soon I just feel like Vietnam is a part of me and I have always said Mexico will always be my first home just because of the connection with the people and the land we Mexicans feel. Vietnam has now become my new first home it’s just an amazing place. Da Nang , Saigon , Hanoi , phu Quoc island, Nha Trang , Long Khanh the list goes on on and the people are so humble and nice.
The food is amazing who doesn’t love PHO or all the taste soups Vietnam has or it’s fried rice or it’s GAO chicken. Don’t forget about the BIA aka beer Tiger beer anyone lol. I just see Vietnamese people be very happy with what they have and they don’t complain they just keep working and working no matter what. People might ask why leave the states we personally the states is expensive first of all life has become literally work, work with no excitement or nothing to look forward too besides bills. Also depending what state you live in like can be decent or boring or just plain out sad.  I don’t need the newest car or newest phone or newest shoes or clothes to be accept which is something what many Americans think that’s the lifestyle. I rather go out with friends family on a motorbike go and get a cafe around 8 pm and chill relax and play some poker or blackjack.  I really hope to move to Vietnam in the next five years it’s hard I know working there and trying to make money it’s not easy for foreigners in Vietnam. Reason for leaving it’s the lifestyle now and the prices and just the boring it gets to live the same routine for average American. I’m not saying America is not a great place but personally for me it’s no longer the same country it was 15 years ago when I was in high school. It’s gone to worst personally.

This is a very specific inquiry, but I’ve been searching for traditional/ancient Vietnamese warrior music. However, the only thing that pops up is Vietnam war era hit music which is not what I’m looking for at all.

Think Thai Samatra or Mongolian throat singing, is there a Vietnamese equivalent? Music that would boost the morale of ancient warriors preparing to march into the battlefield.

This is a poor example because it’s a 1996 song, but if any of you watch UFC, Alex Pereira always walks out to Itsári by Sepultura and he just looks like this Brazilian warlord invoking the strength of his ancestors. I’m looking for Vietnamese music that makes you feel like that.

I am wondering what kind of work can I get based on my background, while I would like to do Learning and Development or anything Education Related, I am not sure if my work experience in Canada would mean landing a job in Vietnam. 

* Based on my background, how hard would it be to find a job? Would it my foreign work experience hinder or improve my chances?
* What is the job market like in general in Vietnam? Are there industry-specific networking groups or professional organizations I should join?
* Which job platforms or recruitment agencies are most effective for finding professional roles in Vietnam?
* Would getting a TEFL certificate be a good idea? How hard is it to find work as an English teacher?
* What are some websites for job posting?
* What banks would you recommend? Are cards and e-banking a common thing now?

**Work experience**

* Administrative Assistant for a non profit that helps people land jobs (Jan 2024 - Present)

Due to the Tet holiday, I decided to visit Vietnam, not only to visit my parents (ironically, my sister, of whom she went NC with me, was also in Vietnam at the time), but also to celebrate Tet over there (my first Tet celebration in Vietnam since 2006 as I moved to Russia in 2006 and then to the US in 2012).

I stopped by:

Ho Chi Minh City (23-30 January)

Can Tho (26 January)

Bình Duong (23, 29 January)

Da Nang (31 January-1 February)

Hoi An (31 January)

Hanoi (2-4 February)

Ha Long (3 February)

Due to me visiting Vietnam, I also decided to add in Bangkok in the mix (16-20 January).

Here are my thoughts about Thailand vs Vietnam (as a Vietnamese, so it might be biased): 

In Vietnam, food and amenities are far cheaper. Even though affordable food is harder to come by in District 1 of HCMC or Hoan Kiem in Hanoi (where there are a lot of 150k+ VND restaurants), many of the low end restaurants sell Pho, Bun, or Com Tam for about 60-75k VND (about 2.40 to 3 USD, and in fact, I even managed to find a restaurant in Hanoi which sold Bun Ca for 50k VND). Many of these lower end restaurants are either elusive (in lesser districts or hard to find in D1/Hoan Kiem) or are street-food adjacent/street food, and funnily enough, despite the fact my two most recent trips to Vietnam (January 2024 and this trip) have been stomach ache free, in 2011, when I visited Vietnam to visit family, I received a stomach bug which caused a lapse in nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain for days, which was caused by Vietnam’s street food. I generally avoid Vietnam’s street food and stick with the quan an or nha hang. In Bangkok, affordable non-street food adjacent restaurants could be readily found in the centre (I even found a restaurant in Tha Tien where a Pad Thai costed 120 baht). Overall, food is on average more expensive in Thailand (where a low end meal would cost between 90-120 THB (about 2.66 to 3.55 USD). Public transit is slightly cheaper in Vietnam, where most city buses are on average 7000 VND (28 cents) compared to 20 THB in Bangkok (59 cents), and the metros are cheaper in Vietnam (7-20k, 28-80 cents) compared with Bangkok (20-45 THB, 59 cents to $1.33). Amenities are cheaper in Vietnam. On average, attractions cost between 40-100k VND (1.60-4 USD) compared to 100-300 THB in Bangkok (2.96 to 8.88 USD).

However, despite the fact Vietnam is cheaper and it is easier for me to navigate Vietnam (due to the fact I am Vietnamese) and even use credit cards as more vendors accept credit cards in Vietnam than Thailand, in my opinion travelling to Bangkok and Vietnam, Bangkok seems much cleaner than many Vietnamese cities with less trash, it is far more walkable as crosswalks are not blocked with motorcycle parking or storefronts, the public transit is better so I wound up only using the taxi to commute from the BKK to the hotel at 6 am and then the hotel to DMK (could have used the bus but whatever), and Thai people seem more friendly and kind, IMO (a bit biased since my maternal family is rather toxic towards me). There are also less aggressive peddlers and vendors in Thailand, the prices are thoroughly delineated (unlike in Vietnam where you would have to ask the price first at some quan an), and there are less taxi/Grab scams. However, tuk tuk scams remains a thing in Thailand. Also, don't forget many Westerners get 60 days visa fre to Thailand whilst  Vietnam grants 45 days visa free to certain European and Asian countries and Americans are required to have an E-visa, which could be convoluting, compared to a visa on arrival. Also, Vietnamese customs leave something to be desired (personally I never had to give any money or was hassled by customs officials, but had to wait an hour), and in Thailand, I only had to wait less than 5 minutes (granted, it was 5 am).

However whenever I read discussions about different cities in Vietnam people always hate on HCMC and rather spend more time at other cities. Why’s that? 

I would really like to hear positive things about HCMC because it makes me a little less excited about the trip everytime someone say HCMC is not worth the visit or just do 1-2 days. 

I also find it interesting how a lot of people are interested in culture stuff but somehow don’t include the museums in their itinerary.

My friend and I booked a one week trip in Ho Chi Minh in the last week of February. Upon planning, we realize that one week is a long time to spend in Ho Chi Minh. We’re really chill travelers, but we realized that there might be opportunity to travel to some nearby areas given how long we’re there for (as tourists).

Since we’re coming from another tropical country, we’re not really that interested in the beaches that much so we’re looking into Da Lat. our concern now comes from what we have planned tentatively which is to leave Ho Chi Minh for Da Lat late at night via sleeper bus and arrive to Da Lat early in the morning. Spend the whole day at Da Lat and then leave for Ho Chi Minh at around 10:30 PM of the same day that we arrived vi Sleeper Bus again. I’m pretty sure that it has been done before but I’m wondering if it’s logical or worth it to do so. 

To add, this is our first time to visit Vietnam and are just open to new experiences that are still quite touristy. So far our itinerary only consists of Mongo land, the flower farm, the waterfall and the alpine coaster. We are very much open to ideas as to what we could do in that lot or if we should even go to Dalat the first place. We’re definitely open to just staying in Ho Chi Minh, but we would need recommendations as to what we could do there apart from the usual tourist spots.

I know our weight limit with VietJet is 7kg (per person) combined for carry-on weight. 

However, our combined carry-on weight will be around 11kg (per person), so 8kg overweight for the both of us. 

When I went to take a look at their excess-baggage fee I saw a section that said 315000 VND per excess KG (link below).  

Can I please get a second pair of eyes on this? Is this information correct? Because that price seems like a LOT. 

If it's accurate, should I maybe look at checking-in my carry-on baggage? It seems cheaper....

This wasn’t just a flight; it was a bold step forward for the pioneering Asian airline.

Departing from vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, Vietjet’s striking red and yellow Airbus A330 embarked on a groundbreaking journey across the Pacific. The route connected Asia to Anchorage, Alaska, and then to Miami, Florida, symbolising a vital bridge for cultural and economic exchange between Vietnam and the US.

This historic flight carried a special delegation that engaged with the US President Donald Trump and key strategic partners. The mission aimed to solidify economic cooperation agreements worth billions of US dollars, marking a breakthrough in bilateral relations.

Throughout the journey, Vietjet’s crew left a lasting impression with their youthful, professional, and dynamic presence. Dressed in uniquely designed European-style uniforms that reflect the airline’s innovative identity, they exuded elegance and energy. These uniforms, previously awarded the “Best Airline Uniform” by Now Travel Asia Awards, further emphasised Vietjet’s modern brand.

At high-profile events, including one hosted at the Mar-a-Lago estate of President Trump, Vietjet’s crew stood out as symbols of confidence and professionalism, embodying the airline’s forward-thinking spirit.

Vietjet’s first flight to the US not only expanded its global reach but also symbolised bold ambition and confidence in reaching new heights. From the Airbus A330 to the vibrant crew, every detail of this journey is a testament to Vietjet’s rise as a global aviation leader.

I want to pick your brains!
My partner and I have just returned from Vietnam. Loved it!
We made the mistake of not buying a print from this amazing shop (several floors of prints ft. Skateboarding women in Ao Dai). They also sold jumpers with designs on (on a rack on the left hand side when you walk in). The prints were around 349,000 and were done by Vietnamese artists.
I believe the name was a play on the word “creative”. I believe the name is in red font on the side/front of the shop.
Can anyone help name/ID this shop? I’d like to see if they’ll ship us a print! 

Let me know if you need more info although I’ve tried to type out what I remember of it!

I'm traveling to Vietnam soon and have a few questions about riding a motorbike there. We're not gonna do a full roadtrip, but we'd rather rent motorbikes in each place we're gonna go to explore the surroundings. (Da Nang for example. with day trips to Hoi An. Hue, Hai Van pass etc.)

I recently got my motorbike license A in Europa, so no limit on how many CC I'm allowed to drive.

**1. Riding with a Passenger**

* Is it common to ride with a passenger on a manual motorbike in vietnam? I've seen video's of people riding with passengers on automatic scooters, but for proper motorbikes i'm not sure.
* I have a full motorbike license from Europe (trained on a 650cc), but I have no experience riding with a passenger. My girlfriend has zero riding experience, so I’d prefer to take her as a passenger rather than her riding solo. Would that be advisable?

**2. Bike Choice & Rental Options**

* I know automatic scooters are easier for carrying a passenger, but since I recently got my license, I’d prefer to ride a manual bike. Doesn't have to be a 650cc ofcourse (I'm used to that but I know you traffic doesn't really allow you to go faster than 60km/h).
* Are manual motorbikes commonly available for rent?
* What types of manual bikes would be best suited for carrying a passenger?

**3. Safety & Protective Gear**

* Can you rent proper protective gear (helmets, jackets, gloves, etc.)?
* Do people even wear protective gear? As I see on the video's on YT, nobody is really geared up, unless the people that go on a full day roadtrip on a big adventure bike. We want to go visit sights and beaches and stuff, but still think about our safety

    I’ve been traveling Vietnam for over a month now. When I first arrived, I unfortunately developed a yeast infection or fungal infection. This terminology is important and determinate on which country you’re from. 

    In Ho Chi Minh City I went to the pharmacy and was able to obtain an intravaginal ovule (egg). The box cost around 50k VN. ($2 for Americans) I was told to use it everyday for 12 days. Here I learned the appropriate term in Vietnam is Fungal Infection. 

   I mistakenly missed two doses but took them when I remembered or skipped the dose and resumed normal dosage. I was also able to buy a topical cream. Upon further research, I learned that the efficacy of this product was less than 75% (as it also is in America) After suffering with recurrent infections for the past year, I did not expect to fully clear the infection.

     Less than two weeks after completing treatment, I started noticing my initial symptoms again. This time I nearly panicked at the thought of going to a doctor. After an hour of online research I found that thankfully, you can obtain Diflucan (Fluconazole) in Vietnam. I was very grateful but apprehensive when I saw you can only get it with a prescription. 

     Over the last 2-3 years, Vietnam has formally cracked down on the illegal distribution and sale of prescription drugs. Fluconazole is a prescription drug. Which really stupid because it’s an anti-fungal not antibiotics. I tried a pharmacy here in Danang and was able to buy 3 pills for 39k VND (a little over  $1).

Yesterday (31 January), I arrived in Da Nang after a 20 hour train ride from Ho Chi Minh City.

Due to the fact train tickets from Da Nang to Hanoi ran out, I decided to book a plane ticket with VietJet Air.

Now, this is not the first time I have booked for VietJetAir nor the first time I went into hiccups with VietJetAir.

In 2023, when I booked a VJA flight for HCM-Hanoi (for January 2024), VietJetAir did not email me the itinerary. Instead, months later, I had to scour through VietJetAir just to be able to find the ticket. I would have had to pay another $95 if I didn't find it (I only paid $70 for the flight).

Now fast forward to October 2024, I booked a VietJetAir flight that took me from Da Nang to Hanoi for February 1 2024 (23:15-00:35 next day). It costed me $90.

Due to the Tet holidays, I was too distracted and focused on Tet. I didn't read any email they sent and also, VietJetAir emails are more vague than Turkish Airlines (the only other airline that scheduled my flight earlier, but by 15 minutes and I always arrive at the airport 3 hours early).

They changed my flight time from 23:15 to 21:35 (100 minutes early). I took numerous trains, buses, and planes throughout Europe and Asia and never experienced this excresence before. All flights/buses/trains were either on time, delayed, or early < 15 minutes.

Afterwards, due to the fact there were no taxis from Ba Na Hills to Da Nang, I waited from 18:10 until 18:50 to actually return to Da Nang. I arrived at a restaurant at 19:40 thinking that the flight will land at 23:15.

I finished eating at 20:00, ran to the hotel to retrieve my laundry (15 min walk), and arrived at Da Nang Airport at 20:45. I checked in, but due to the fact my bag was too heavy, I had to send my bag as a checked bag and it costed 325k VND ($12.96).

I arrived at security at around 21:05 (the boarding time), and due to the fact I was adamant my flight was at 23:15, I forgot to read and just took a seat. I brought 3 phones with me (two personal 15 Pro Max, S24U, one MP3 iPhone SE 2), and at around 21:40, I realized I lost my iPhone SE 2. I went all over the airport and even exited security, and by the time I returned to security, they found my iPhone, but due to the fact I missed my flight, I had to rebook the ticket.

It costed me 530k VND ($21.13) to sit on the 00:35-01:55 flight from Da Nang to Hanoi.

Luckily, I am still waiting but I am 80 minutes delayed from my original plans.

TL;DR: Due to the fact I forgot to double check my itinerary to find out the flight got moved 100 minutes early, I had to pay $21.13 for the flight.",False,False,0.59,"","2025-02-01 17:42:04","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

I’m trying to find a specific Vietnamese music performance from around 2007 (possibly from Paris By Night, Asia, or Van Son). The performance had a dramatic storyline with a fantasy or ancient-themed setting. Here’s what I remember:
	•	There was a male vocalist
	•	There was a lead female vocalist and who had her eyes taken in the story
	•	The girl who lost her eyes had bloody eyes and sang
	•	The girl who took the eyes didn’t sing and might have worn green (not 100% sure).
	•	The stage and costumes had a cosplay/ancient attire theme.
	•	The performance had choreographed storytelling that included this eye-stealing scene.

Text from posts: Mùng 3 tết tại metro 

Chuyện là hôm nay gia đình em có chuyến đi metro. Ban đầu, mọi thứ vẫn bình thường khi gia đình em lên tàu trước và ngồi chung một hàng ghế. Kế bên dì em là một cô áo dài xanh đang giữ chỗ cho con trai vì lúc lên tàu hai mẹ con bị lạc nhau. Sau đó, một gia đình khác lên tàu và yêu cầu chị dâu em (đang mang bầu) nhường chỗ vì họ có mẹ già 80 tuổi, chưa kịp nói gì thì họ thì đẩy bà vào ngồi chen giữa chị dâu và em họ em.

Khi gia đình em lên tiếng rằng chị dâu đang mang thai, họ mới dẫn bà cụ đi rồi quay qua liếc 1 cái.
Sau đó bên họ đi lên thấy cô áo xanh đg giữ 1 ghế bên họ yêu cầu cô nhường cho bà 80 tuổi.

Dù đã có người khác nhường ghế ở phía đối diện, họ vẫn khăng khăng đòi bằng được. Khi cô áo dài xanh giải thích rằng cô đang giữ chỗ cho con trai (đã hơn 20 tuổi), họ vẫn không chịu buông tha và thậm chí còn lao vào đánh cổ (như trong clip).

Dì em thấy bất bình vì gia đình kia lớn tiếng quát ngay bên tai rồi đánh như vậy, nên mới lên tiếng bảo họ im lặng. Rồi bà 80 tuổi xông lên chửi dì em. Lúc đó anh em không nhịn được nữa và lên tiếng (như trong clip).

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

I am an American looking to write a story that contains Vietnamese-American character with strong ties to his culture (his parents having moved to the states and passed much of the culture down to their children), in addition to passing the culture on to his own children - he has three. 

What kind of things would you advise someone to avoid doing in writing a Vietnamese/Vietnamese-American character (other than blatant racism, obviously), and what sort of things would you like to see represented in a character? Essentially - how can I portray and represent this culture in his parents, him, and his children in an accurate way? For Vietnamese characters written by non-Vietnamese authors, what have you seen done well and what did you think was in poor faith?

Additionally, what are some names that are fairly common/popular; this character has a daughter and two sons. Not all may have a Vietnamese name; their mother is from a different culture, after all, but I think at least one of his children would. 

I will of course be doing my own research in order to represent this character, but I figured I would ask people who have actual ties to this culture (as opposed to me, who does not) what they feel are good representations vs bad or iffy ones. What are bits of this culture that are often left out or ignored, and what are common to Vietnamese characters that may not be very accurate to Vietnamese culture?

They want my vietnam born cousin to marry my one cousin so that she can legally become a citizen and pursue college here. She really wants to be a doctor. She’s 21 and attends a college here in Ca Mau province. I told them she would have to start over because she’s not attending an international school that is recognized. And even then, I don’t know if she would even meet acceptance criteria. Her English is very, very beginner. She doesn’t say full sentences but can pick up short phrases I say here and there. I don’t think she’s unintelligent, just very unprepared and naive about the standards here to attend a reputable institution, alongside a language barrier. 

I’ve heard of some viet exchange students successfully graduating here because they’ve learned English since a young age and attended better schools. I don’t think she’d fare well in collegiate level education. 

I think my family is vastly underestimating this situation and I feel bad because I don’t want her to be uprooted and be disappointed after such a big move. 

My one cousin immigrated here during high school for a better life. She slowly learned English and graduated but she never went to college and instead went into nails. Her quality of life is definitely better but I know they expected more from her. So I’m worried my cousin will struggle thinking a white collar career is waiting for her if she just goes to school here.

I'm planning a special trip for my parents (both 50 years old) to Vietnam for their 25th wedding anniversary. They prefer a short, budget-friendly trip (4-5 days or more if necessary) with a mix of relaxation, sightseeing, and unique experiences.

Since this is a milestone celebration, I want to make it memorable for them without going overboard on costs. They enjoy scenic landscapes, cultural experiences, and light adventure (nothing too extreme).

I’d love some recommendations on:

* The best cities to visit for a romantic yet budget-friendly experience
* Must-visit attractions (beaches, cultural sites, nature spots, etc.)
* Unique experiences they shouldn't miss (boat rides, shows, etc.)
* Budget-friendly but comfortable places to stay
* Local food they must try and affordable restaurants

I haven't opened any boxes as I left my tripod back home in the US.

I bought:

Sup Gameboy for 260k VND (around $10.40)

XP5 that resembles Nintendo Switch Lite for 750k VND (around $30)

Knockoff AirPods (off brand) for 350k VND (about $14)

TG 177 for 270k VND (about $10.80)

Hoco W35 headphones for 450k VND (about $18)

Radio for 200k VND (about $8)

Because the combined value is under $800, do I have to declare if the quantity is great?

I am being flagged for secondary every time I return to the US (doesn't affect other countries however) due to the fact in October 2023 (also the first time I was referred to secondary), I took a day trip to Sherbrooke Quebec for a tour and bought frozen food due to Market Basket in MA closing early and declaring all of it at the border crossing at Derby Line VT (frozen pizza, frozen shrimp popcorn, frozen nuggets, lays chips, coca cola, etc). Luckily, I filed a redress number and got my redress number however.

Would I be fined or jailed if I didnt declare any Chinese products? I bought them to try to do a shopping haul, and none of them has copycat apple or Nintendo logos. They are just off brand products with very weird brand names.

According to hireright (as of January 20 2025), I have no court records.

Should I just dispose all the boxes? Luckily, I do have some relatives and friends in Da Nang, and they could definitely keep the products for me within Vietnam. I am going to Da Nang next and am currently on the train.

I don't wanna buy in supermarkets, and I don't want to get ripped off at local markets or haggle when not knowing the base price, since I'd hate to be an asshole to someone offering me a fair price.

Is there anyway of knowing what local people pay? I tried asking local costumers that are there at the moment or asking neighboring shops.
Is there an application you'd recommend for this? I mean for fresh food.

The anecdote that got me to post this: the chicken streetvendor in the pic asked for 200k for a whole grilled chicken. Prices weren't written anywhere. I felt like I was getting ripped off since a kilo of frozen chicken breast cost 90k.

This happened right after the bread incident so maybe am tripping.

How much do you pay for your roasted 🐔?

Price ranges I found in local markets for anyone who's interested:

Sweet 🥔:30k/kilo
🍞 loaf:20k
Bahn mi: 3-3,5k/piece
🥭: 30-40k/kilo

I just finished Oxalis' 2D1N [Hang Va Expedition](https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-va-expedition/), and since I had trouble finding reviews of it while choosing which tour to do, I thought I'd talk about my experience for future travelers. I went in late January.

I was between mainly this one and Hang En, the consultant I spoke to recommended Hang Va since I had more trekking and climbing experience. Apparently Hang En is mainly trekking through the jungle and, though you're camping there, you spend less time in the cave. I think she said you don't have to use your hands at all.

Hang Va is more technical. We started with an hour trek through the jungle (it was raining so a bit steep and slippery but no problem), then had lunch at the cave entrance. We donned our helmets and lights and descended into the cave. Honestly the first hour or two I thought were kind of boring. Probably interesting if you're really into caves, but for me it was kind of stopping a ton at each rock , fungus, etc. and talking about it for a long time. It was like being at a museum. At one point we even shut off all the lights and meditated for five minutes LOL.  They'll stop at some spots and set up lights and take pictures for you, which end up looking super professional.

Later on it picked up. Theres some scrambling and climbing with a harness here and there. We had to go through a smaller passage, crawling and then mud crawling- but you're not squeezing or anything so for non-claustrophobic people I think it will be fine. Then you have to swim for about ten minutes with a life vest- I'm a bad swimmer and was fine, there's a rope you can use to pull you. It was cold, but not horrible. At the end of the cave, you strap into a harness to climb up about 10 meters to exit the cave.

We were wet as hell and cold, but at the campsite they have a fire and even a steam bath in a tent. We chilled and had a huge dinner, then stayed up talking with the guides around the fire for a while. You sleep in tents that are set up when you get there and the sleeping bags are warm. I was in a single tent, couples were together.

Day 2 was way more action-packed. You descend into the same cave by climbing down in the morning. Then you're basically following the underground river, waist deep in sections holding on to the wall, scrambling up and down and between rocks, harnessing back in later to climb across the wall of the cave (kinda half climbing, the ground is just sloping). You end seeing the hundreds of cones from the title picture, then go back the same way. The way back was super fun cause we were going faster. Climb back out the same entrance, have lunch and coffee, then start the jungle trek out. It's steep at first, you scramble a bit up and down the hill. It was muddy for us but very doable. Go through a river crossing with leeches and end at a bridge where you can have a drink and take some pics for a mission complete!

Overall, the tour was super fun for someone into hiking and climbing. There were 6 in our group, most were pretty athletic but one wasn't I think. She had twisted her ankle the day before also so was going really carefully and a guide was by her side the whole time. She was going a bit slower but was able to do everything with the guide, so if you're not experienced or particularly athletic I think you can still do it fine! The cave is not as high as some of the others but quite long, and some formations are really stunning. It's a wet cave the whole way. One of the guides told me it's his favorite tour to do, but specifically in the summer. You can also smoke cigarettes at meals if you're into that, but no alcohol.

Most of the participants were older twenties- forties and professionals, probably since it's pricier. As a backpacking 20-something y.o., at first I felt a bit spoiled by the quality and thought that I could've done a cheaper tour no problem. But tbh, when we were deep in there under piles of rocks that looked like they'd collapse if one shifted, I was kinda glad to be with such a well-established company, lol. I wish I knew a bit more about where the money goes. I trust it's being used well, and I can see they're really big on conservation, but the price is quite steep (for the region at least) and you still have to pay for the hostel the night before. Still worth it, imo. (EDIT: u/Vietfunk commented below about how the money is used for the community.)

I friend and I (both male in their 30s) will travel to Vietnam in Mid Semptember (15th) for about 3 weeks.

We will land in Hanoi and so far i planned the Ha Giang Loop tour (3days, 2 nights) and a stop in Sapa for a Trekk around, lasting 2 days (1 night) before going back to Hanoi. After this I was planning to take the long ride train to Hue where we would stay 2 nights, move on to Da Nang where i would love to visit the golden bridge and the nearby Hoi An (maybe daily trip maybe staying the night), chill on the beach and visit historical places. 

By then it will be about the 27th of september. 

  
We like to eat and to hike wheter possible.

What should we do now? 

We fly back on the 6th of october so we could either fly to HCMC from Da Nang o take a train to Nha Trang and from there after a day or 2 take another 11h train to HCMC.

  
Is that a lot? what could we do inbetween? should we stay more in the center of Vietnam and travel to HCMC a couple of days before the fly home?

I'm currently focusing on another language, but I do plan to make Vietnamese my next target language in the near future. I'm leaning towards Northern Vietnamese, but I do have some questions that have been running through my mind before I truly make a definitive decision. And forgive me if some of these questions are dumb / have obvious answers. 

1. Is the Vietnamese from the North and the South generally mutually intelligible between both regions? I'm aware that Central Vietnamese is a bit more unique. But I'm wondering if North and South generally grow up exposed enough to each other's way of talking (similarly to American and British) that they're more or less accustomed to the difference in pronunciations and the most common region-specific word differences. I don't know just exactly how similar or different they are. Can the average Northerner and Southerner have a casual conversation without much issues?

2. Part of my asking that first question is that I wonder how Vietnamese handle traveling to the opposite region. I would assume there's not any issues. But is there such a thing as ""code-switching"" (for lack of a better term) for Vietnamese people? Is it common for a Southern to deliberately use some Northern words if they find themselves in the North, and vice versa? Or is the mutual intelligibility strong enough to where everyone can just talk how they usually talk without much issue?

3. What influence do the respect accents / dialects have in media? I'm someone who likes to use media and reading to learn. I'm wondering for things like Netflix movies & series, Youtube series and variety shows, vlogs, etc.; is either Northern or Southern more dominant in mainstream entertainment media?  It would help know what to expect and where to focus my attention if I want to focus on media that's in a certain dialect.",False,False,0.59,"","2025-01-29 09:57:22","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

It's a mainstay on every feasts, but the only dish that no one will ever touch and end up being a leftover for 2 and 3 days and ultimately in the trashcan (oops). Why? The bone is not edible and it's just a pure nuisance. It pierces your mouth. it destroys your teeth if you accidently bite on it. Not a wonderful experience at all. If you want to have a big piece, just cut them along the joint so you don't have to deal with those tiny bone shards.

My girlfriend and I are traveling around SEA. We booked a nice hotel during Tet as we saw that everything closed down during these days, and it was nice having a solid place to stay (way too fancy for us). 
A local politician came tonight (New Years Eve), and both him and the hotel manager gave us money and explained it was a tradition. We thanked them a lot and said that we didn't have anything for them and they answered that it was totally fine. 
It felt like we were ""for show"" for the politician and it meant a lot for the hotel manager that we were there.

Here is the google maps but again, it's not his fault! It's called [Quynh Mai Resort Phu Quoc. ](https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/s/Kat9bjkJ8X1aUdQPA)

Please don't comment on how this place only has 1 review, we cross referenced on google and it looked legit. We had our previous airbnb cancel 21 hours before we were supposed to arrive so we were in desperation mode.

My question is, how in the world are we supposed to tell that this was a fake listing? The place is legit, there were 103 reviews on google. Do we have to call every single hotel from now on and ask them where they list their bookings? 

Second, what is even the point? They don't get money until they check in and now, the owner of Quynh Mai is on to them. Is the scam for the cancellation fee?

This subReddit has been massive in planning my trip to Vietnam coming up in 2 weeks, especially understanding the cruises/Ha Long bay, Cat ba and treks in Phong Na etc. 

For Ha giang; I am very comfortable with bikes and planning to get an international drivers license. I want to ride along with my partner solo and not in a group. I plan to spend 4-5 days in Ha giang. Could you'll help me with the following; 

1) Can I just get to Ha giang and find a bike or is blocking prior recommended? Don't want to waste a day after reaching there. Any names contacts will be greatly appreciated. 

2) What are the possibilities of leaving my chunkier luggage at a place and just carrying a day bag for both of us for those days? Assuming lighter is better to ride and enjoy the route. 

3) Will the company I am taking my bike; suggest me the route? Or do I need to reply on google maps?

4) We love nice and quaint homestays/boutique hotels etc. Does the biking company do a package deal for this with the bike? Or should I do this bit myself on online portals?

5) Is 4 days enough or what's the best plan/route to enjoy Ha giang and surrounding areas?

I'm just a fellow Vietnamese from a buddhist household whom only cared about getting Li Xi at Tet that, sadly grown up and now started to be interested in what's the actually meaning behind these fancies. Let's not beat around the bush no more and start with my little own insight.


FYI In Tet, there are 5 special days you gotta keep in mind. It's January 25th, 29th, February 1st, 2nd, 3rd of the Yin Calendar ( The usual calendar is called Yang Calendar, Yin one is the smol little day and month at the below of a calendar). We buy stuffs and celebrate things in these days.

Jan 25th is Ngày mở cửa mả ( a day of visiting the deceased), no idea why they pick this day tho.

29th is Tết cuối năm ( Year end Tet, celebrated in the day before 12pm with salty foods and fruits but no sweets). Actually it's not 29th but the last day of the last month of Yin Calendar.

Feb 1st is Tết đầu năm and Tết Cha ( New year Tet aka Lunar New Year Tet, and Dad Tet, New year Tet is celebrated at midnight to wait for 12 am to pass with sweets and Dad tet means you gotta visit your parents). Here we go, it's when kids start to ask for Li Xi and the adults get the blessings.

2st is Tết Bạn ( Friends' Tet, gotta visit who've been accompanying with you through hardships).

And 3rd is Tết Thầy ( Teachers's Tet, gotta visit who taught you precious things in life).



When Tet comes, Mom and Aunties prepare flowers, fruits, sweets, incenses, ingredients for foods and do the cooking ( Let them cook, don't argue, you lose anyway). If you can cook, you can join, they will give you the sauce but if you can't, it's fine, just remember to light the incenses, this is a must. According to my house ( My home is Buddhist), there're at least 6 altars when Tet comes. And these are:


An altar for all the ancestors, is put in the front of the house, need 3 incenses.

An altar of Buddha or any member ( Mine is Phật Bà Quan Âm). As for Christianity, I think they have one too but I'm not sure if the rest are the same. If you're from a Vietnamese Christianity household, please share me some insights.

An altar of Ông địa - ông thần tài ( Earth grandpa - The soil protector and the wealth god, they're good fellows with each other), need 1 incense. Normally this altar can be seen in any household.

An altar of Ông táo ( Apple grandpa - the fruit ambassador) in the kitchen, around where you put sauces, sugar, salt or any sussy combo that you created.

An altar of Ông trời ( Sky grandpa - the weather ensuror) on the upstair balcony, at the front door's direction.

( The 3 men do their job just by existing. Man, I wish I'd been them.)

And finally, altars of your grandgrand mother/father, your grand mother/father,... 


Now here come the orders of the incenses. Light 3 incenses first on the front door altar. Then, from the high to the low, gods are most priorities, then the grandgrand mother/father, grand mother/father,... If you get hurt while putting these incense, it's a sign of their trying to warn you something about this year. 

For example, I got hurt by accidentally touch the other incense when putting the lighted on sky grandpa's altar, that means I gotta be extra careful about something related to weather this year. 

If it's from the soil and the wealth duo, better not gambling and play it safe.

If it's from apple grandpa, it's about health issue.

Ancestors and gods are hard to guess tho, they might don't like something in the house, someone in the family maybe be doing something bad, the deceased will be here for a while ( good or bad depends on the state of the incense, if the ashes made a beautiful intact curve then it's a good sign)


About the fruits, it could be any combo that you wish you have for this year base on their name or color. For example: Cầu ( soursop) vừa ( Dừa - coconut) đủ ( papaya) sài ( xoài - mango) make the phrase cầu vừa đủ sài - Enough to go for the day. 

Another example is long ( Đỏ - red from dragon fruit is represented for good luck) vừa đủ sài - Enough luck to go for the day.


In the end, it is just what you think it is. You can do it correctly or not, you can visit any of the above or not nobody give a damn ( but the one who's close to you and a**hole might do) But if you visit, make sure to bring visiting gifts for the family and the Li Xi for kids.

Where is the source you ask? Obviously. Mom and aunties.

Tình yêuTình yêu đôi khi là một trò chơi đầy nghịch lý giữa trái tim và lý trí. Người ta nói răng không muốn liên quan, nhưng lại không thể ngừng nhớ về nhau. Có những cuộc gọi tưởng như vô nghĩa, nhưng thực ra ẩn chứa cả một bầu trời mong mỏi, một nỗi đau không nói thành lời.Đối với người thực sự yêu, câu trả lời không chỉ là một sự đáp lại, mà là lời khẳng định rằng họ sẽ luôn ở đó, bất kể mọi rào cản hay tổn thương. ""Anh sẽ luôn trả lời"" không đơn thuần là một câu nói, mà là lời hứa rằng dù em có cố gắng đẩy anh ra xa, anh vẫn chọn ở gần, vẫn chọn yêu thương.Có những người yêu nhau nhưng vì tổn thương mà muốn trốn chạy, lại không biết rằng chính bản thân họ vẫn lặng lẽ tìm về ánh sáng duy nhất trong cuộc đời mình. Gọi một cuộc gọi, có thể chỉ là một hành động bốc đồng, nhưng bên trong đó là tiếng kêu cứu của một trái tim đang vùng vẫy giữa mâu thuẫn: vừa muốn từ bỏ, vừa không nỡ xa rời.Và người đáp lại, chính là người sẵn sàng trở thành bến bờ, dù biết rằng chẳng có gì đảm bảo cho sự hồi hương của con thuyền lạc lối.Yêu không phải là chờ nhận lại mà là sự kiên định trong những khoảnh khắc dễ buông tay nhất. Đôi khi, yêu là chấp nhận việc trở thành chốn an yên để người kia chạy trốn, ngay cả khi bản thân mình cũng đang tổn thương. Và có lẽ, điều lãng mạn nhất không nằm ở việc người kia thay đổi hay quay lại, mà ở sự thật răng: có một người sẵn sàng yêu, ngay cả khi tình yêu ấy chưa bao giờ thuộc về họ hoàn toàn.Tình yêu đích thực không phải là sự níu kéo hay áp đặt, mà là sự kiên nhẫn chờ đợi và sẵn sàng lắng nghe. Đôi khi, người ta cần khoảng cách để tìm lại mình, nhưng cũng cần một người luôn sẵn sàng ở đó, như ngọn hải đăng giữa cơn bão, để bất kỳ lúc nào quay lại, họ biết rằng trái tim ấy vẫn chưa từng rời đi.

I am on a golf tour with my family, and really enjoying the courses and the city. I'd like to know how much is a normal amount to tip your caddy. Can anyone help me get an idea of this?

 My tour guide, who works with the golf travel agency I used, says that it is normal to TIP caddies 500.000VND ON TOP of the caddy fee we pay to the club. Is this true? I want to tip my caddy, but 500.000 sounds like a lot for a tip. I live in the Philippines, and 500.000 VND is the total amount I usually pay for my caddy fee AND tip. My idea of a normal tip amount to a caddy is equivalent to 200.000 or 250.000. 

My tour guide says 500.000 is ideal because the caddies do NOT get to see a cent of the caddy fee paid to the club. This sounds completely wrong and illegal to me. My tour guide is not good at speaking English though, so I may have misunderstood him. Regardless, he keeps insisting that we must tip the caddies 500.000 VND per game.

 The course I played at today is Legend Hills. My caddy was great and I was already about to tip her 400.000, but my tour guide saw this and insisted i pay 500.000. I was too embarrassed to deny the caddy who was right in front of me, so I paid her 500k and frankly I am really annoyed with my guide right now. So I want to ask other people who actually live and golf here. How much do you tip your caddy, outside of the caddy fee? Hope someone can help me understand because I do want to tip fairly. Thanks.

They all said how they thought everything is overpriced, and were cussed at and even grabbed physically when they walked away. One shopkeeper didn’t let me enter her store because ‘I won’t be able to afford her’. I mean, no one told me that in Europe, but sure I won’t be able to afford stuff in vietnam.

""Fans are often used in Vietnam during the Lunar New Year, or **Tết**. They hold cultural and symbolic significance in Vietnamese traditions. Fans, especially traditional hand fans, are sometimes used as decorations or given as gifts because they represent elegance, beauty, and a connection to Vietnamese heritage.

During Tết, you might see fans incorporated into dances and performances, such as the **múa quạt** (fan dance), which is a graceful traditional dance. These performances are especially popular during celebrations and festivals as they showcase cultural pride and artistry.

Additionally, decorative fans, often painted with scenes of nature, flowers, or traditional calligraphy, are sometimes displayed in homes during Tết to enhance the festive atmosphere and bring good fortune.""

I thought I would just post my experience in the hope it helps anyone.

I have an early flight HCMC to Dalat in coming weeks. I left my middle name off the booking as they are not commonly required for domestic flights where I come from. Read a lot of conflicting opinions and views about whether it was or wasn’t required and whether people were successful at getting on the plane without a middle name on the booking when your ID has a middle name on it.

So I emailed Vietjet directly using their support page. 
It took about 8 hours for a response. 
Email said “Hey I have left my middle name off my upcoming booking, how do I fix it? Do I need one? Is there a cost involved”. 
Response was to “please provide the booking reference and a copy of my ID (passport)”.
Did this and around 12 hours later.
They explained they can do a name change, only once, and it would cost $6.91 AUD, would I like to proceed and they wanted me to confirm the new name details.
Agreed and confirmed and about 12 hours later was sent an email with a new itinerary and the cost I paid through the app directly when I pulled up the booking. 

It was zero fuss and they were really easy to deal with. Honestly I didn’t feel like rolling in for a very early morning flight and having to deal with it then. So if you have a week or so before travel and you think you may be in this situation it’s easy enough to have it sorted before you arrive at the airport. 

Their contact details can be found here-:

The whole process was very easy and their customer service staff were very helpful.

Does anyone have any recommendations for an alternative to Sa Pa that’s relatively accessible from Hanoi and Ha Giang. Under consideration at the moment is Ba Be or Bac Ha but open to others.


I’m currently travelling in Vietnam, have been here for 6 days now and I’m really enjoying it.
I have a friend from home meeting me in Hanoi next Saturday 1st February and the plan was to head to Sa Pa next Monday/Tuesday before doing Ha Giang. However, as I understand it Sa Pa is heavily touristy and given that the loop is now also like this, I’m looking for an alternative to Sa Pa. Sometimes it’s good to do the touristy things, it’s that way for a reason but after 3 months travelling I try to blend touristy with less touristy. This replace Sa Pa with something more off the beaten track for some trekking and outdoors time. Weather doesn’t bother us.

News recently broke out that Atlanta DJ, hype man, and rapper DJ Unk passed away at 42. He was best known for his hit ""Walk It Out"", which went crazy in like 2005.

I distinctly remember surfing YouTube as a pre-teen like 2007 and coming across a Vietnamese version of 'Walk It Out'. For context, I'm not Vietnamese at all and I have no ties to Vietnam. I'm Filipino and at the time I was living in the US. But it was the first time I really paid attention to any Asian rap.

In fact, that video let me to a rabbit hole of Vietnamese rap videos. That's how I discovered Andree Right Hand (maybe he was on the 'Walk It Out' remix I'm looking for, IDK). That's also how I discovered 'Vietnamese Gang' by Khanh Nho and Thai Viet G. 

So even though it's nearly 20 years later, I still occasionally think about that spitfire Vietnamese over DJ Unk's titillating beat. It was hypnotic. But even though I went as far as trawling long-dead MySpace pages, I just can't find it again.

I can’t count the amount of times Vietnamese people have tried to pay for my meal or buy me beers at a nhậu 

One time I got into a minor accident (both of our faults) and we got into a major shouting match and I called him “ngu” and “tập lái” and all kinds of shit cause I was angry. Then I took a second to calm down and said “Em rất xin lỗi anh” and he said “Không sao, xin lỗi em.” We shook hands and smiled at each other, then went on our way.

These are all small things, but I’ll always remember them. I just wanted to say thanks to the Vietnamese people for treating me so well 99% of the time.

Since the summer their facial recognition software was never able to identify me but it was never a problem, since I only used their app for small transactions, not transactions over 10m VND. However, since the new banking regulations on 1 Jan I've been unable to use their app, since they now require face ID from everyone.

Their last message to me told me that their app's AI can't recognise the faces of some foreigners. I'm a white guy with a beard, it seems the beard might be confusing the app. I've given up on Timo now.

Yesterday I opened an account with Techcombank, and lo and behold, same problem. To do the first transfer the app needs to check my biometric thingy using a photo (I know in the future it'll only be for transfers over 10m VND, but for the first transfer on a new account it also needs to do it) and despite trying multiple times it failed every time, giving me error message code 58215 and the error message 'No person detected' and 'Sorry, we cannot identify a person in the frame'. So it's not even detecting I'm there, never mind not recognising me.

We did another trial last night: I tried a transfer, then my wife (who is Vietnamese and doesn't have a beard) did the selfie photo. The error message was different, reading 'Your selfie doesn't match the photo on your ID', different to the error message I was getting. So, it seems with me, the error isn't that the software can't match me to my photo. It's that the software can't even recognise me as human and so doesn't even try!

Has anyone else had this problem? Especially, have any western men with beards had this problem?!? It's becoming very frustrating, of course. I've got an HSBC account already which works and (so far...) seems to be immune from the biometric ID policy (they've never asked me to take a photo which is charitable of them). I hope they don't start, I'll be left without a local bank account otherwise, and I'd rather not rely on HSBC for everything!

I’m an aspiring professional photographer, and I have a 3-month vacation planned in Southeast Asia. One of the countries I really want to visit is Vietnam, where I’d love to do some beach photo shoots for couples.

I’m not planning to charge any money for these shoots—this is purely for building my portfolio, as a hobby, and for content on my blog. However, I’m concerned that this might raise issues with immigration. Since I’ll be entering the country on as a tourist, I’m worried they might assume I’m doing it for business purposes, even if I’m not accepting any payment (officially or under the table).

I’ve read stories about foreign photographers in Bali being caught and deported for similar activities (because, according to local laws, they were considered to be taking jobs away from locals), so I’m wondering if this could also be a problem in Vietnam. ([the most recent case](https://www.reddit.com/r/bali/comments/1i8m4pg/passport_confiscated_by_immigration/))

Let me vent about my nightmare with Vietjet Air and their shady practices to avoid paying compensation. Here’s how it went down:

* **Original booking:** Flight scheduled for **22 January 2025 (VJ1634)**, from **Ho Chi Minh (19:05)** to **Da Nang (20:25)**.
* **Pre-departure change:** One day before the flight, Vietjet updated the schedule to **20:15 departure, arriving at 21:35**, citing **""flight operations""** as the reason.
* **Chaos on the day of travel:**
   * They changed the departure time **twice** more, both times blaming ""flight operations"":
      1. From **20:15** to **20:50**.
      2. Then to **21:10**.
   * Actual departure? **23:24**. Arrival in Da Nang **01:03** (see image below or [flightradar 24](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/vj1634)).

* **Shady compensation policy:**
   * Their website promises compensation for delays exceeding **4 hours**.
   * Instead of calculating the delay from my *original scheduled departure* (**19:05**), they used the revised time (**20:15**) to dodge liability.
* **A Messy, Stressful Process:**
   * The constant changes made it impossible to check in online.
   * It felt like a **first-come, first-serve scramble** to get an actual ticket with a seat number at the airport counter.
   * On the airport itself there were 3 flights departing from the same gate at almost the same time (?), making me stand in the queue thrice for nothing. 

After 4+ hours of waiting, missed plans, and total exhaustion, Vietjet brushed me off without compensation. Their excuse? ""Flight operations"".   
  
Is there anything we can do to get compensation? They rejected my request already. According to the website of *skycare baoviet*, it bases the departure time on 20:15.   
I know it is a waste of time, but it feels wrong for them to get away with this every single time just because they have a non-existing customer service and their sneaky tactics.

Once people started to notice everyone got their phones out and started recording him. He tried to run away but people chased him and kept recording. 

It’s his 30th birthday in a months time and I would love if anyone had some footage of this. All of our friends have heard this but if anyone has a video it would truly make the night.

I (23M) am curious what is open for Tet? During Christmas and Thanksgiving, even though many amenities are closed in Boston, you still find fast food and immigrant owned family businesses open over there.

But what about Vietnam?

The reason why I am asking is because yesterday, when I was at my parents house in Binh Duong, I had an altercation with them due to the fact my sister (23F) who lives all the way in Boston (the same city I live) will come to Vietnam for Tet and I am paranoid of a heated confrontation, so I felt like it is safe to avoid contact with family.

In Vietnam, notably in Da Nang where I am now, it seems like older women (50 up) rarely smile when eye contact is made and I smile or say hi or xing chao, even if I am buying something or being polite/friendly/trying have a positive interaction. 

Most of them literally just stare at me with empty eyes like I'm an alien without saying hi back, or sell me something with zero effort/expression of any kind (?)

For reference, I'm 30M Canadian. Maybe we are a bit sensitive to this, it is common courtesy to say hi back where I'm from, and to not stare people down with a serious face 😅

I've got the same feedback from foreigners I've met, but am wondering why this is the case and if there is a better way to get them to open up/or be friendly?

It is my second visit to this wonderful, amazing country and culture and, despite being so, so, *so* sick for the majority of it, I have had an excellent time.

I just wanted to say thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for this opportunity. I was invited to spend time with a friend here who I met during an internship for our degree (we're both studying social work). At first I was reluctant - because I am very low income at home - but her enthusiasm and openness convinced me and I bought my tickets in July.

I have spent a little time in HCMC with my friend and then I spent some time up at Hoi An and I am, again, blown away by the culture and generosity of the people here. I am always reading about scammers and things going wrong on this sub so I just wanted to put a little bit of positivity out there for those who might see all the negativity and think everything is shit.

I returned to HCMC last night. And I couldn't find the taxi stand I needed. I had precooked a taxi but there were none at the airport where the booking said to wait. After wandering around, overwhelmed by the heat (thanks, HCMH, you welcomed me with beautiful weather last week and now you're back to Darwin weather), I went to the airport help desk. The lady there was an excellent resource. Back home, I would have been given directions and expected to figure it out. Here? She went out of her way to help me.

I got to my hotel and my friend ordered me dinner as I was not doing too hot. The food is amazing. Even the cheapest, most 'fast' food here is amazing. It's a shame that Australian food isn't nearly as good. I am always amazed by the amount of salad greens in everything. A good amazement. I think I've eaten the most leaves here in my 9 days then I have in the previous year!

Back in Hoi An, I got a bunch of clothing made. At the tailor's, I asked the assistant where I could buy some fabric shears for my friend back home who is cat sitting. She went and *bought* them for me after saying the locals would up the prices for a westerner. And she refused a tip (I know Vietnamese don't tip, neither do Aussies, but here I have the means to do so).

My friend, who I have been visiting with, took me to a tailor in HCMC too to get some things made. But due to Tet they won't be finished until after I leave. So my friend is going to pick them up and bring them home with her! And, because I was staying with her at her home, I got to see a part of the city I wouldn't have otherwise (Hoc Mon).

I cannot express how much I appreciate this country. I will certainly be back.

That said, I'm never flying Vietjet again! I'll pay for the more expensive flights with Vietnam Air! The delays are simply too overwhelming to manage. My flight *to* HCMC was delayed by 6 hours. My flight to Hoi An by 2 and my flight back to HCMC would have been delayed by 3 but the attendant kindly managed to fit me onto an earlier, still delayed, flight. But, even with all that? My time here has been absolutely amazing.

The people. The culture. The cities... there's nothing quite like it. At least for me. Even HCMC with its noise and humidity. I lived in Darwin for almost 20 years and have sworn to never live in that hell-hole again. But I could quite easily live in HCMC.

He also prepared another coconut for my wife.  You can guess what happens to next...  He wanted 150000 VN for the 2 coconuts.  At the time, I was still in shock  and gave him 100000.  BTW a typical coconut costs about 50000 at most in a typical shop.  Lesson learned - do not engage with street vendors if you aren't interested.  I also saw a lady with a fruit cart doing the same to a tourist, and offering some fruit for an exhortive price.

The goal is for it to be a sentimental package, something that helps us feel closer despite the distance.

I’ve heard that Vietnam has restrictions on used consumer goods and clothing, but I’m unsure how to navigate the customs process for personal gifts. Has anyone here shipped personal items like this to Vietnam before? Any tips on how to avoid customs issues or avoid the package getting delayed or rejected?

Also, is shipping items like aftershave (perfume) allowed, or are there any restrictions I should be aware of for liquids?

Another thing would my girlfriend be able to do the same like send me one of her t shirts or jacket, her perfume? Are the rules less strict sending than receiving within Vietnam?​

Currently, we don’t have children and are considering relocating to either Da Nang or Ho Chi Minh City.

I have applied to MBB consulting firms in Vietnam, but there hasn’t been any progress yet. My husband plans to find a remote job. Visa requirements won’t be an issue for me, and my husband can obtain a Temporary Residence Card (TRC) through his spouse status.

I’d appreciate your insights on the following:
1.	Living in HCMC vs. Da Nang

How do the two cities compare in terms of quality of life, cost savings, and navigating office politics? We travelled to Da Nang and love it there, unless I have a remote job or just start a business, I dont see any job there for me.

2.	Dealing with Cultural and Practical Challenges

How do you personally cope with issues such as inconsistent policies, street trash, noise, or inconsiderate behavior? Are there effective strategies to handle these daily annoyances?

3.	Income and Lifestyle

Our goal is to maintain a combined monthly income of approximately $10,000 USD while enjoying a comfortable lifestyle in Vietnam. Would this be realistic in either city? We are also considering purchasing a home.
	
4.	Career in Management Consulting

I’ve heard mixed feedback from overseas Vietnamese about working in management consulting in Vietnam, particularly regarding office politics and the lack of structured operations in a rapidly developing industry. Do you think this would be a suitable career path for me, given my background?

5.	Starting a Tech Business

For context I am 24F, from the US and have travelled to Vietnam a few times to see my local VN girlfriend. I have a BS in Marketing.

-I hear to get a work visa you have to get approved by the embassy and get the work visa after getting approved for the job in order to move there for the 2 years (with renewal), but I see a lot of advice saying people moved there on a tourist visa and then did everything while there. Is that easier? I feel like it’s more difficult if you have to change visas once you’re there, right? Or do I have this all wrong 😅

-A lot of people get the TEFL to teach there but I see a lot of sources saying that only a Bachelors is needed for a lot of english teaching centers, is the TEFL really necessary? Or just recommended? Not against getting a TEFL, just curious if it’s worth spending the time/money getting. 

-Work life balance? I’ve noticed mixed reviews. I would move to HCMC— what are normal hours for teaching centers? I’ve heard 25hrs a week and 40hrs a week, 400k+/hr. I’m sure there’s a lot of factors so it may be a silly question.

I would prefer insight from expats or people with experience. I’ve posted in a few groups and get hit a lot with comments from non-expats that just tell me to not move to VN and that’s not really helpful.

I am going to be travelling through central Vietnam in late January/early February.

So far I have accommodation booked in Hoi An from January 29 for 3 nights until February 1, with plans for day trips to My Son and an additional day trip to the countryside through my hostel. I need to be in Dong Hoi on February 3 as I leave for a tour in Phong Nha from there on the 4th.

What I'm struggling to decide is how to spend February 1 and 2 before I leave for Dong Hoi. A few options I'm considering:

1. Stay in Da Nang from Feb.1, departing for Dong Hoi on the 3rd, skipping Hue.

2. Stay in Da Nang Feb 1, then Hue the 2nd, then leave for Dong Hoi on the 3rd. This one certainly will be the most rushed.

3. Stay in Hoi An an extra day until Feb. 2 with the extra day essentially being a day trip to Da Nang, then head for Hue on Feb. 2, and Dong Hoi on Feb. 3. I understand that this may be a bit too much time in Hoi An, which has been described as quite touristy in some other reddit threads, but I would be spending time in My Spn, the countryside tour I mentioned, and Da Nang, and moreso using Hoi An as a base.

What do you recommend? I'm generally interested in both history and nature. I'm not the biggest beach person in the world but I do hear that the beaches in Da Nang are really nice.

Question about expectations for Airbnbs/apartment rentals:

We arrived in Ha Noi this afternoon and have rented an Airbnb with a nice wooden, one-person bathtub in the bedroom. 

As we tried to fill it, the hot water ran out before it was 10% full. When we asked the host about it, they responded that it is an energy saving hot water heater and therefore it takes ~3 hours to fill, as you have to run through the small water heater's tank, let it recharge, and then drain out the water that has gone cold while you waited, repeating the process until full. 

Is this normal/reasonable? Or am I justified in taking this up with the host/Airbnb?

I want to be mindful of differing expectations in different places, but it feels like a misleading listing at best. Not trying to be that Westerner who comes in demanding everything be like it is at home.

AITA? Thanks for the feedback!

---
UPDATE:

Thanks for the quick feedback. It really helped me solidify our position/approach this with greater confidence.

The host offered a 30% refund on the stay, which I believe is fair. 

He did keep trying to explain how to fill the tub over the course of 3 hours, but eventually offered the refund when I pointed out that if the instructions were reasonable, he would have them posted on the Airbnb listing, not in the apartment to be read upon arrival.

Last year I spent a 3 weeks beach side and one week riverside (Novotel). Much preferred beach side.  Golden something( haha ya I know there are a lot).

Per month for 2 months .   I have a Vietnamese national friend that told me I should do nha trang this time “nha trang is more fun. Conversation better in many ways.  Beaches is just right a city  . My khe beach is not right at city central.you can easy find anything in Nha trang) 

I’m looking for a condo serviced or not where I can chill. I love to eat local food and am not afraid to try new foods. Want to be near or on a beach in a place that has a balcony. As a bonus I’d love to be in an area where there are expats. I’m Canadian but it doesn’t bother me if it’s been trampled by Russians Chinese Korean etc.  this is not my point. 

Does anyone have recommendations of what area of Nha trang that would suit me best?  More specifically….what buildings?  Once I know the building name I can research to see what’s available on various websites including fb groups. I want to be close to bars and restaurants for people watching and strolling.

Thought Id just chuck up a few things you can do there pretty easily, which Ive seen a lot of people on this subreddit say you cant - plus some phrases that the locals will appreciate (also only book hostels online don’t bother with tours and that you can negotiate better prices when ur there and u might meet people doing one u wanna do)

**Hanoi:** (Try thuốc lào (tabacco pipe) if u dare, the local boys will invite you and be  very impressed if u rip it)

* The old quarter is where its all happening, nightlife, food, lots of shopping (make sure to barter). If you want to meet people stay in a hostel near pub street (Hanoi Rooftop Bar and Backpacks was great
* Take a walk to the lake near beer street then, go to the Hanoi prison and the Ho chi minh museum + the big inside clothing market not far from there
* Learn how to greet the locals properly they appreciate it,  Cảm ơn = Thank you, Cảm ơn anh = older man, Cảm ơn chi = Older woman, Cảm ơn em = younger person, Cảm ơn bat/ban = brother/friend, Xin chào = Hello (u can use the gendered terms after saying Xin Chao as well)
* Find as many Anthony Bourdain joints as possible, theres also heaps of Michelin star spots that r cheap
* Weed and Mushrooms are so easy to buy on beer street (at night) just be lowkey about it - you shouldnt pay more than 750000 for 3.5gs and its actually good shit - our hostel was chill with smoking on the balcony but we didn't risk smoking on the street obviously. Most pharmacies will sell diazapam, ritilin, oxies, codine and tramadol, I had no problems getting these at most pharmacies in the Old Quarter

**Cat Ba Island**

* Dont go to Ha Long Bay and do the whole cruise shit, I mean if that appeals to you then sure but we just went to Cat Ba, rented scooters (didnt even look at our licenses gave them 7500 dong for 24 hours and we were off)
* Ride to the hospital cave (just search on map and ride roads are nice and paved), then another cave just past there, then to the national park where you can climb a big mountain
* 12 hour boat cruise the next day, food included, bar on board, you stop at multiple spots to swim and snorkel, visit floating fishing villages and some whack monkey island (fuck monkeys)

**Ha Giang Loop** - You cant go to vietnam and not do the loop its the best no doubt no question

* IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE YOURSELF AND YOU DONT HAVE A LICENSE IT IS PISS EASY TO GET AWAY WITH YOU WILL BE FINE - JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DRIVEN A FUCKIN BIKE BEFORE REGARDLESS - None of us had licenses but we had all driven bikes in India so enough said

* We planned it out as followed: 3 of us travelling the loop together, we got 2 easy riders and 1 regular semi auto, we did a 3 night 4 day trip (do the extra night its worth it) so each day one of us had a go driving and the other 2 would cop easy driver
* At checkpoints ur tour guide will just stop 200m from the area, another driver would hop on your bike then when you were past the checkpoint he would jump off and youd be on your way again.
* The roads really arent that dangerous if you are paying attention, obviously they are dodgy in some points and its more so the big cliff drop offs and sharp corners, but the drivers never really go above 40kms and the max they let me go on a straight was like 80
(If you get an easy driver tip them like 500k they are legends and u want ur driver as ur friend)

**Sapa**

* Wasnt the biggest fan, they seem to have started a lot of new commercial development there and its lost a lot of its rural feel
* The ""ethnic"" villages near the town centre are just rows and rows of stores selling the same things and older tribe ladies tryna sell u hash, theres an alright water fall at the end but its a bit underwhelming
* We were sick most of the time in Sapa so my recs are shit, the tallest peak in south east asia climb is worth the visit alone, provided the cable car back down is actually working.

Even though it rained at times, it didn’t make getting around difficult at all.



Now, I’m planning to visit Sapa again, but this time with my parents. I really want them to experience what I did during my trip.



Initially, I thought of visiting from late March to early April. Some sources say this is the best time to visit Sapa because the weather is ideal, and the blooming flowers add to its beauty. Considering my parents are older, this time seems like a comfortable and safe choice for them.



However, one of the most unforgettable parts of my previous trip was the breathtaking view of the lush green terraced rice fields covering the mountains. That scenery left a deep impression on me, and I wonder if I should reconsider the timing to ensure they see that iconic view. Of course, there are many other impressive aspects of Sapa, like experiencing the daily life of ethnic minority groups (e.g., the Hmong people) or taking the cable car up Ham Rong Mountain.



What do you think? Would blooming flowers and nice weather be a good alternative to the lush green rice paddies. Or is it worth waiting for rainy season just to see them again sacrificing nice weather?

Chinese EVs have also recently been banned from the US.

Would Trump tamper with Vietnamese Companies if they were to reach the heights of WhatsApp or TikTok?

I am concerned because as a Vietnamese American who became a naturalized citizen in 2021, I have always wanted to revolutionize a sector in tech. My close friend (also Vietnamese, UMB alumni), two students at my alma mater (MIT), and I are working on an AI startup, and despite having some US connections, my father is a prominent government official and his nephew (my cousin) is owner of one of Vietnam's biggest venture capitalist firms.

The core demographic for my company are affluent tech-savvy and adventurous westerners, and my foray to Vietnam (mainly through affluent customers) is mainly to catch some market share and receive venture capital before expanding in the western markets.

Should I be concerned due to my father having communist ties? I know this may be an arduous endeavour, but IMO, if a Vietnamese revolutionizes a tech sector (i.e. with Flappy Bird or Vinfast), it may catch national attention. But of course, some Vietnamese products fail such as Vsmart.

Luckily, I networked with several prominent executives in my industry in the US, and I feel like my friend's alma mater of UMass Boston (we will delegate the CTO title to him) would hinder our foray into YC.

I finished booking hotels for my Vietnam trip in February. For the Hanoi hotel, I came across this beautiful aparthotel called Rainbow Apartment and something came over me and booked the place right away (I think low prices and free airport shuttle also helped, but now looking back, I should have known).

After booking, I looked up the address and Google Maps couldn't find it... And I started to feel weird about this place, so I just did a simple Google search and it was coming up in only a couple websites. I just kept looking up the address in different map applications, tried street view, and nothing...

I just came back from work and everything clicked. It was too good to be true and those 5 reviews were too positive. I did Google search again and even less websites than yesterday had the posting. Although on Google it said it had a lot of reviews, once you click it, there's only 5 that friggin have the same dates! And looking back at the pics, THEY WERE ALL AI GENERATED!! And I thought I was being smart warning my husband about AI scams...

Anyways, it DID say no refund, so I'm willing to bite the bullet and lose about $130 USD...

  
I'm just posting it here so that people who are going through this subreddit for info do not make stupid mistakes like me.

I'm just unsure because it's huge, they say it's 1kg and they live with two people so maybe it's wayyy too much. I liked the idea of this one because it's sweet and she's already making dinner so bringing something that's also savory/dinner food makes me scared to interfere with her dinner plans. However, I can't find a smaller version of mứt tết in my country...

I guess my questions are: 1) is this appropriate to bring or too much? 2) if it is appropriate, is this something that will expire soon or can they eat it over a long period of time?

I’m planning a special family event and would love some advice. My partner and I are thinking of renting a Big house in Ho Chi Minh for our holiday celebration and wedding reception from December 23, 2025, to January 2, 2026. The house would need to accommodate 8 adults and 6 young children.

We’re planning to host a few events:
	•	A Christmas celebration - around 20-30 people
	•	A wedding reception with about 100 guests that might run late into the night
	•	A New Year’s Eve party - around 20-30 people

If anyone has experience hosting something similar in a private home, what are some things to keep in mind? 
Any tips for finding the right property, managing the logistics, or ensuring everything goes smoothly for both the events and our stay?

Our budget is 350.000.000 VND - 14.000 EUR / USD
Most of the budget should go to the rent of the big house and wedding coverage

Thank you in advance for any tips and trick ;)

Hung didn’t just teach us about the Hmong people; he made it entertaining. ’This is where the Hmong grow their corn,’ he’d say, before adding, ‘And where you tourists grow your fear of heights.’ He also introduced us to the infamous “happy water” (Hmong rice wine). One sip of that stuff and, yeah, I was happy, and singing Cheri Cheri lady with random people from all over the world. 

Quyet, on the other hand, was the calm to Hungs chaos. He was my driving, every time we made a stop, he took all my gear off and then put it all back again. He didn’t mind all my dumb questions while I point things out on the road. He was so skilled on the bike that I barely noticed how narrow and winding the roads were because I was too busy taking in the jaw-dropping scenery. Every twist and turn was like stepping into a postcard—terraced rice fields, towering karst mountains, and tiny villages that made me want to quit city life forever.

The ride was safe, the food was amazing, and the laughs were nonstop. If you’re on the fence about Ha Giang, do yourself a favor and go for it—just prepare to leave with a heart full of memories and a liver slightly confused by the happy water.

During their rule in French Indochina, numerous atrocities were committed. France also abandoned Vietnam during World War II, allowing Japanese occupation. However, they did contribute to the development of cities like Hanoi and Saigon.

If you know any of them personally, you would know they did not grow up in a rich family. So how are they able to live such lives? 

The sad truth is most of them are actually working ladies.What do i mean by that? Through the connection of their friends or sisters, most of them travel to these places like thailand, cambodia, singapore and dubai to work in KTVs or prostitutions to fund for their lifestyles. The money they can make in a short time is far beyond the average salary of a vietnamese for a few years. The temptation of easy money and materials led them to a path of sacrificing their morals and body as a result.

KTVs in thailand, cambodia, singapore and dubai requires the working ladies to allow customers to do pretty much whatever they want with the girls. This would mean that despite the clean, luxurious image they portray on their social media.. their body have already been tainted by countless mens of all ages. How else are they able to travel to these countries and lead a luxurious life of dining in high end restaurants and staying in 5 star hotels without having a proper job in the first place? What you see on their social media may not always tell you the truth about the secret life they lead but there are always signs e.g videos taken in fancy restaurants, overseas in mentioned countries, receiving expensive gifts, on the passenger seat inside a car. 

They may fool you by appearing in the video with a group of girls.. but guess what? The whole group of them are actually also working girls in the same industry. Its easy to fool most people by flaunting their material products and luxurious life but the fact is they chose the easy way out by selling their body for it. Most of them have photos taken in similar studio background which is used as advertisement for the clients and they will definitely have apps like wechat or telegram. 

I have friends who dated a few of these girls working in KTV before and most of the girls already have a boyfriend in vietnam. They just lie about travelling overseas for work and dissapear between 2 weeks to 6 months. In between that period of time, only god knows how men they have to serve to afford all the expensive items they now carry. Most of them carry the hope of marrying a rich man through the job but none of them realize that they will never get to enter the family as they are just a working girl meant for every man's pleasure. They have to put down their pride to serve every customer who has the dollar bill to spend, be it old, married, ugly or disgusting. 

End of the day, what you see on these girls social media may not always be a life of glamour as they have sold their soul and body for it. After what ive mentioned, i guess you can comb through your social media to see if any of the girls fall under these categories.

\- Hire a car + driver

Is it even possible to hire an easydriver directly without a tour? Anyone know how much this would cost per day?

Also, would it be possible to find a car cheaper when we arrive rather than booking online? Or do we risk all cars being booked? We would arrive in the afternoon but don't mind adding a day in Ha Giang to look for easyriders/a car+driver.

They're coming to visit for the third time next month and have paid for a nice vacation in Phu Quoc for us and my wife's family. I'm very happy about that.

However, my family is not rich and I would never ask them to send money to anyone, including sending money to my wife's family for the marriage. I'm independent and would feel shame to ask them this, as they would assume I'm getting scammed or that my wife does not love me. They would think she simply just wants money and tell me not to get married to her.

My wife's family was fine with this initially, which I thanked them for. However, her mom keeps bringing it up now, and my wife says both her and her parents feel emberassed about not getting money during the marriage. She already has full access to all my money (although she already makes great money with her job and often pays for our things on her own), and I proactively said before that I'm happy to send her parents money of my own, but she says the $10,000 I offered is not enough, so just forget it. I also offered to help them move to the USA and they don't want to, so I'm not sure what exactly to do.

Uploading here on Reddit as our review (with images and videos) somehow do not show up on Google Reviews. What we experienced was shocking and dangerous, and we believe travelers need to be aware of it. **Hotel name is Aaron Boutique Hotel.** It has multiple 5 star reviews daily, almost like they were posted by bots, and honest bad reviews (including ours) are somehow blocked from showing up. Mods please advise if I'm not allowed to name the hotel directly here and I'll remove the name.

**TLDR; hotel roof broke in on us in the middle of the night flooding the pool water above us into our room and level, hotel did zero service recovery, fire alarms in the whole hotel do not work, staff response to safety concerns alarming. Video evidence provided. Stay at your own risk.**

We chose this hotel for a 2 night stay middle of last year because of the great reviews, but our experience was a nightmare.

We were on level 12A right below the swimming pool, only 2 rooms on that level. At 5am on the first night the roof broke through. We woke up to find pool water raining into our room, across the whole level and the water level rising steadily beneath our bed and feet.

We tried to press the fire alarm to alert everyone else but the fire alarm was not working at all. It took three calls to the night reception and panicked yelling to get him to come up to our level. He couldn't understand it was an emergency and kept saying he would come later.

Power sockets were really low and the water level was reaching them, bringing real fear of being electrocuted. We had to step into the ankle high water to dash through the doorway which had a curtain of stinky water raining down.

We had to leave most of our belongings, valuables and electronics behind in the drowning room. When we finally reached the lobby, we were just left sitting around with hand towels to dry ourselves off and waited almost an hour without any news or updates or concern. I get that language might have been a barrier for the night staff, but our neighbours were Vietnamese too, and they were left hanging like us. We had to go up to him after an hour of sitting around stupidly to request for a new room to wash up. No idea what the plan was if we hadn't made the request, to leave us there until the morning staff came? We asked about the situation, and he just pointed to this one handyman who came to the hotel with a few tools in hand. The one and only lift was then stopped and from then on for two days everyone in the hotel had to climb the stairs up and down.

Once we were issued new rooms, it was as though we were out of sight out of mind. Nobody ever came to check in or give us any updates or offer any help. We had to climb up and down ourselves to check if the water had subsided, pack and collect all our belongings to bring them to our new room, wash and dry all our items because they absolutely stank and settle ourselves as best as we could. While doing that we tried the fire alarms on every level and NONE of them worked. It was like the alarms were for display only.

The biggest joke was when we came back in the afternoon and the daytime receptionist told us the lift was down. We told her we were in the rooms affected by the incident, and she froze like she didn't know how to react and just smiled apologetically.

We were incredibly frustrated by then and when checking out, we requested to see the manager and was first told the manager was not around, then that they were out of town, and then that the staff did not know the Manager's number so we couldn't even speak to them on the phone even though the staff clearly just called the manager.

Some guy came in from outside then to say he was the manager, and when we explained the whole situation asked us what we wanted. We requested for a refund and for the fire alarms to be fixed. He wanted us to sign a document stating that we had gotten the full refund, that we were satisfied with all the arrangements by the hotel, and that we were not to post any bad reviews on the booking sites or Google? We refused to sign until they showed us that the fire alarms were fixed but he kept claiming they were. When we wanted to test it he got upset and said that if a fire broke out and anyone died they would just deal with it then?! We were shocked and did not sign the document.

The hotel failed horribly on basic service recovery, and even more shockingly on basic safety measures.

Both my partner and myself posted a review on Google and both the reviews just simply didn't show up, (I couldn't see his, he couldn't see mine, and on Google reviews it showed 0 views, no idea how they did it), so I now doubt the authenticity of all the glowing reviews on Google.

  
**EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has been helping to repost this review out. I've left a review on Tripadvisor as well. Please feel free to share my review anywhere that could be helpful. Both my partner's and my reviews are actually still not showing up on their Google maps, but I can see some copies of my review re-posted by others. Not sure if that would be flagged as bots then but at least people see it now. I noticed the hotel has marked themselves ""Temporarily Closed"" but the booking options are still available.

Specifically, according to the Government's report to the National Assembly on the damages and aftermath of Typhoon Yagi on October 22, 2024, Typhoon No. 3 resulted in 345 deaths and missing persons, with the total economic loss estimated at 81.703 trillion VND (equivalent to 3.2 billion USD). The provinces that suffered the most significant damages were: Quảng Ninh with 24.876 trillion VND and Hải Phòng with 12.249 trillion VND.

In this regard, Typhoon Yagi is the most economically damaging typhoon in history (the damages from Typhoon Yagi alone exceed the total damage from all natural disasters in Vietnam since 2020 until before the typhoon made landfall). It is also the deadliest typhoon in Vietnam in the 21st century.

Although it was forecasted early and with the cooperation of the people and local authorities in proactive prevention efforts, the damages were somewhat reduced. However, the typhoon’s forecasting and its impact raised many questions due to significant discrepancies compared to the forecasts and reports from international meteorological agencies, especially with the leak of a report from the Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) sent to the Northwest Pacific Typhoon Committee (ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee). This document, quite lengthy (30 pages), summarizes research and details about all the doubts regarding the forecasting, assessment, and reporting of Typhoon Yagi’s intensity. The document contains some technical terms that may be difficult to understand, but they can be summarized as follows:

* The Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) forecasted and assessed the maximum intensity of Typhoon Yagi over the South China Sea as being lower than the predictions from other reputable regional meteorological agencies.
* NCHMF also predicted that Typhoon Yagi would weaken over the Gulf of Tonkin before making landfall in Vietnam with winds at 11-12 bft. This forecast was significantly lower than the predictions from other agencies in the region.
* During the landfall of the typhoon, NCHMF only reported once the data recorded at the Bãi Cháy station at 14 bft when the typhoon began its strongest impact at 14:00 on September 7, 2024. Subsequent reports removed this data. During this time, NCHMF reported Typhoon Yagi made landfall with winds of 12-13 bft.
* It was not until the report and bulletin on September 21, 2024, that this data reappeared in full detail. The Bãi Cháy station recorded 45m/s (14 bft) at 13:00 on September 7, 2024, with gusts at 62m/s (17 bft). In this official bulletin, NCHMF confirmed the typhoon made landfall with winds of 13-14 bft.
* Two months later, a report, allegedly from NCHMF, was sent to the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee for presentation at the annual conference from November 19-22, 2024, in Shanghai. This report indicated that the Bãi Cháy station recorded winds of 50m/s (15 bft) at 13:21 on September 7, 2024, with gusts at 63m/s (above 17 bft). It reported the typhoon made landfall with winds of 14-15 bft. This report was later cited on Wikipedia. Even an article in the Justice Newspaper (Báo Công lý) at the end of 2024 briefly mentioned this original report.
* After this information was leaked, the next day, another report was issued, replacing the previous one, although it was identical to the old one (even retaining the same spelling mistakes and place names). It simply adjusted the Bãi Cháy station data back to 45m/s at 13:00 on September 7, 2024, with gusts of 62m/s, and the typhoon made landfall at 13-14 bft. This updated report remained unchanged after the Typhoon Committee’s meetings.
* When asked about the 50m/s recorded at Bãi Cháy at 13:21 in the old report, Deputy Director of NCHMF, Mr. Hoang Phuc Lam, confirmed the existence of that number but argued that it was incorrect due to the station's measurement being at an improper height and being an automatic station. The 45m/s recorded at 13:00 was from a manual synoptic station.
* However, manual observations only occurred eight times a day at specific hours (01:00, 04:00, 07:00, 10:00, 13:00, 16:00, 19:00, and 22:00), making it difficult to accurately assess the full strength of the typhoon. In the official report on September 21, 2024, several other stations were mentioned as automatic stations at various heights, including the Phù Liễn station.
* The data from the automatic station at Bãi Cháy was used in reports and evaluations of the intensity of many previous typhoons in the region before Typhoon Yagi but was excluded when reporting on Yagi’s intensity.
* NCHMF had previously been known to issue inaccurate forecasts but still reported the closest possible intensity domestically, only releasing precise data at international conferences like those of the Typhoon Committee and then revising it domestically in the following year, such as in the case of Typhoon Mirinae in 2016.

It is important to note that the entire incident mentioned above has **not** been discussed by any mainstream media, either domestic or international (except for Báo Công lý on December 31, 2024, which briefly referenced the 50m/s and 63m/s gust data at Bãi Cháy). The excerpt from the Justice Newspaper briefly mentions the issue:

*Yagi đổ bộ vào Việt Nam với sức gió vùng gần tâm bão đạt cấp 13-14 giật cấp 16-17, tại Bãi Cháy (Quảng Ninh) ghi nhận sức gió 45m/s cấp 14 giật 62m/s trên cấp 17* ***(tuy nhiên một báo cáo ban đầu của ngành Khí tượng thủy văn Việt Nam gửi Hội thảo lần thứ 19 của Ủy ban Bão Châu Á-Thái Bình Dương ESCAP WMO Typhoon Committee cho biết bão đổ bộ với cường độ cấp 14-15 và sức gió tại Bãi Cháy là 50m/s – cấp 15 giật 63m/s – trên cấp 17)****, được Chính phủ đánh giá là cơn bão mạnh nhất trong 70 năm qua trên đất liền nước ta.*

My wife and I are going to northern Vietnam next month, and I'm not going to be able to fit everything in that I would like to do. I've all but decided on a tour with Mr Linh's Adventures to Ban Gioc and Ba Be Lake, and Lan Ha Bay with Rosy Cruise. What I'm trying to decide is what to do with what time we have left.

We'll be able to depart Hanoi as early at 09:30 one morning and stay somewhere one night(maybe two, but we have a flight at 15:00 on that third day. We'd probably opt for a night bus if we go to Sa Pa).

I hear mixed reviews about Sa Pa, and worry about it being overly touristy, but I'd love to take the cable car up Fansipan.

Since we're doing Lan Ha bay, I figure we can cut Ninh Binh.

We could always stay in Hanoi, but we aren't really city people. Then again, we've never been to Asia and it'll certainly have a different feel than other cities we've been to.

Any other suggestions? I'd like to say we'll be back to see what we miss this time, but there's so much world to see that we rarely go back anywhere.

I’m only planning a couple days in Phong Nha as I have a fear of enclosed spaces, so while I’m happy to go into a cave for a bit (on the halong bay tour or into paradise cave) I don’t want a full day tour - I want it at my own pace, have the ability to leave, one of the more open caves and certainly won’t want to spend the night sleeping in a cave.

Arrive into hanoi late on our first night, dinner, check in

Day 1 - explore Hanoi

Day 2 - early bus or car to Ninh Binh, explore

Day 3 - tour or excursion of or from ninh binh

Day 4 - hike and chill around Ninh Binh

Either overnight bus to Phong Nha or fly in the morning from Hanoi

Day 5 - explore Phong Nha

Day 6 - explore Phong Nha

Day 7 - bus or car to Hue, explore

Day 8 - explore Hue

Day 9 - either travel to Hoi An and spend the day, or bank and extend Halong to two nights

Day 10 - explore Hoi An

Day 11 - explore Hoi An or beach day (if spending three days in Hoi An)

Day 12 - fly back to Hanoi, explore the city

Day 13 - early morning tour to Halong bay

Day 14 - finish Halong tour, afternoon in Hanoi

Day 15 - morning flight home

Beaches and nature spots across the country are ruined by it, and of course it's everywhere in the cities too. I was shocked at times, whilst driving inter-city through fairly untouched countryside to see trash everywhere. Seems like a lot of inconsiderate practices, trash burning and general disregard for the natural environment. 

Is it an education thing? Poor infrastructure? In the case of coastal trash, does a lot end up on the shore from other countries?

Seeing the recent introduction of heavy (and controversial) fines for traffic violations, do you think a similar change around trash would be effective, welcomed or warranted?

Can you recommend some more chill activities, sights for this leaving day? Can you sleep in a hotel a hotel for couple of hours with same day checkout? Are there hourly hotels maybe?

I highly appreciate the Vietnamese TV archivist community on YouTube who preserved the graphics of (mainly) VTV and SEA-feed Qnet channels.

Hi all, hoping you can help me with some inspiration please? 

We’re slow travelling for a year (working at the same time so tend to spend a week in a place so we can do 5 days work / 2 days off) and planning to head back to Vietnam in February. We plan to spend a week in Hanoi at the end of February but have 2-3 weeks to fill before that and can’t decide where to go! 

We’ve already visited HMC, Ninh Binh, Da Nang and Hoi An and so would have a preference for somewhere new! 

We’re probably planning a week in Hue and then the option for the other 2 places would be Sapa, Cat Ba, Phong Nha, Nha Trang, Mui Ne, Con dao, Phu Quoc, or Da Lat. 

Geographically the only ones that seem to make sense are Cat Ba and Sapa? I.e. fly from hue to Hanoi and go from there then back to Hanoi! We can afford to fly cheap internal flights and would prioritise travel time given we need to work. 

I can’t quite seem to make a workable itinerary of 3-4 destinations (with a week in each) from places we haven’t been? And most of the online itineraries are for first timers to hit the places we’ve already been. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on sapa, cat ba, phong nha, nha Trang, Mui ne, or da lat? Any that are a better for spending a week than others? I.e. more to do, more food choices, etc. We need reliable internet and like to have a few things to do, nice cafes, running routes and good food! Does Sapa fit this or is it really all about the trekking? And is Cat Ba worth visiting after the typhoon? 

Is there anywhere else that you’d recommend that I haven’t thought of that works well with Hanoi and Hue? 

In terms of interest we like history, culture, food, walking, running, scenic views, etc. Not thrill seekers and we don’t drink.

I am going back to Vietnam with my wife as of recent, something like a honeymoon, and I need help from fellow redditors.  
  
First time in Vietnam was in Da Nang in 2024, didn't like it that much, found it kinda boring and soulless tbh and I didn't like the big city feel.. Hoi An was cool, we went only for a night tough, it felt authentic and tourist friendly at the same time.  
  
I am searching for something very specific after checking out Ho Chi Minh City - hopefully not impossible. 

We enjoy to motorbike around and explore surroundings, we love good local food and nice bars, good beaches are a must, excellent to have at least some party options (not the commercial type more into quality electronic music lets say.

Our first trip together was to Koh Phangan in Thailand back during COVID and we had a BLAST, so that is in some way our ""ideal"" place - a bit secluded, you can chill all day on nice beaches, but you have the option to check out bars, and good parties if you decide, with tons of cheap local food options and lots of stuff to drive around and see.

Basically, we are searching something that is not overly touristic, but at the same time not too tourist unfriendly with a lack of options to visit, eat, drive to...   
  
As they say - the ""golden middle"".

Multiple options / destinations / islands / towns are obviously doable, we don't need to stay at the same place all the time, nor are we strictly against sleeping at resorts or nice small cabins/air bnb's.

For now I read about:

\- Quy Nhon, seems like the best option for now, some comments on it being a bit boring.  
\- Phu Quoc, seems like definitive no, overly touristic, resort only type of vacation, high prices for Viet.  
\- Nha Trang, looks and feels similar to Da Nang?   
\- Côn Đảo, sounds interesting but really small island and without any nightlife.

Hope this makes sense.

Thanks a LOT in advance!

So People told him to move to red note and he said the Vietnamese government doesn't allow red note. Is that true or is it possible he is confused because the app isn't called red note in Vietnam but something else, like the Chinese name, xiaohongshu, or some other name for the Vietnamese market ",False,False,0.6,"","2025-01-14 10:04:15","2025-01-14 12:48:18"

A Spring Morning

One spring morning,  
A child went to the fields,  
Stepped on a landmine, slow to yield,  
His legs were blown apart, no longer real.

One spring morning,  
A child chest shattered and torn,  
A thousand wildflowers of the fields, forlorn,  
Bowed down to gaze upon her heart, outworn.

Oh, dear child, school bells ring today,  
In the playground, silence holds sway.  
That lessons of love on paper is still new.  
Why now does the ink fade from view ?

One spring morning,  
A child lies still and calm,  
A blade of grass held in her palm,  
With fragile yellow flowers, a soothing balm.

One spring morning,  
A child lies silent, deep,  
His lips seem to whisper, secrets to keep,  
""Is there a heaven,"" his soul does weep?

I was wondering if you could give me some advice. Myself and a couple of friends are flying from Da Nang (DAD) to Phnom Penh (PNH) via Ho Chi Minh (SGN) in a few weeks with Vietnam Airlines. We have a 1h55 layover in which we will have to change from the Domestic Terminal 1 to the International Terminal 2. I have a couple of questions about this:

1) Since our flights are booked under 1 ticket, will our baggage be sent all the way from Da Nang to Phnom Penh or will we have to pick it up at SGN?

2) Will 1h55 be enough time to clear customs, security and potentially check in? 

3) There is only 1 Vietnam Airlines flight per day from SGN to PNH. If we do not make it (either because of a delay of our first flight or because of long queues at SGN), could Vietnam Airlines put us on a later Air Cambodia flight instead? I only ask because their flights show up on the Vietnam Airlines website.

4) If it doesn't seem likely that we will be able to make our second flight, do you think I could contact Vietnam Airlines and ask them to put us on an earlier flight from DAD? There are earlier flights that would give us a 3h10 or a 6h10 layover. Note that we only have Economy Lite tickets so I don't think we're entitled to change.

Education outside of formal education can be an option in many cases, though there are also ways to get a degree that allow a person to self-educate and then take certain tests, at least when it comes to most degrees.

A lot of people in the US don't know about this, though.

From what I've heard, there seems to be bias for status and achievement within the context of bias for authority or a single role in Vietnam. The US has that too when it comes to education. I think South Korea, India, China, and possibly Japan do as well. 

Given what I've said above and given patterns related to that nested set biases I've observed, I'm suspicious that some of what people are told is correct regarding education.",False,False,0.89,"","2025-01-14 01:56:53","2025-01-14 02:31:07"

Pre-having a baby this was the best place ever, vibing, everyone so lit and partying. Post-having a baby this place is torture.

Everyday is a struggle, here is my list

\- Smokers EVERYWHERE, and if you ask them to stop smoking they smirk and smoke even harder. Absolutely shit-tier behavior. I'd expect this from ghetto people in my home country.

\- Everybody is in a rush, they push and shove you to get out of the way. Having a kid is viewed as a burden/slow for the flow of traffic. noone lets us go first nor holds the door for us

\- Everybody has an opinion on how you should raise a kid, but also says it in a demeaning manner talking down to you...the kicker is they will have the nastiest fingers and touch your kid. Or the woman says something, while their husband is smoking a cigarette in front of their kid.

\- Honking all throughout the day, for absolutely no reason. I drive a scooter, taking a left turn. a car or bike at least 100meters+ behind me 100% of the time will floor the gas pedal and speed up hoping to pass me. Like brody if you just let me turn like normal we wouldn't be in danger and you wouldn't even lose a second of your life to begin with. The drivers here are absolute animals on the road. They even pass on the right, or simply won't let you pass at all EVER.

Every night is a struggle, here is my list  
\- Vietnamese karaoke til midnight, hard to put baby to sleep (there is noise violation laws on paper, but they aren't enforced, so I am in the RIGHT to be upset over this)

\- Houses are built wall to wall, neighbors are walking heavy footed stomping and slamming doors, making noise like crazy. Ask them to quiet down, they blame society make so much noise, why I have to change? Live here so long no one ever complain.

\- Honking all throughout the night

It feels as if everyday moving around Vietnamese, it is a power-struggle/fight. EVERY POSSIBLE MOMENT they can beat you in movement, they will, even if it risky and puts us all in danger.

Of course, I could report them, but what cop is going to do anything about this? In a civilized society could call cops, reasonably expect them to show up and have the neighbors get fined so they can act civilized. Also, just from my experience and hearing others stories, Vietnamese are terrible at dealing with conflict. Never accepting responsibility, no accountability, and childish retaliation behaviors. It is quite scary to think about just politely asking a Vietnamese to improve their behavior, because they may just end up peeing in your yard everyday in retaliation. Resorting to bully tactics.

We already left the country, just leaving this as an honest review for others.

EDIT: I think the comments from fellow citizens of Vietnam have proven my point in the conditions and view points the society has towards the vulnerable people of society (children+pregnant women). For the people who think that my review comes across as ""entitlement"". I did a little research and please do know that your country Vietnam agreed to commitments as part of their membership within the ASEAN member states as well as the global space for all the things I had mentioned. Vietnam literally committed to providing all the things I had mentioned. They should take notes from fellow ASEAN member states and learn and implement better policies. 

**1. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)**

• **Vietnam’s Status:** Vietnam was one of the first countries to sign and ratify the CRC in 1990  
• Emphasizes the best interests of the child in all actions (Article 3).  
• Calls for an environment conducive to children’s development and well-being (Article 27).  
• Recognizes the need to protect children from harmful environments that disrupt their mental and physical health.  
• Calls for measures to protect children from environmental harm, including secondhand smoke.

**2. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)**

• **Vietnam’s Status:** Ratified in 1982.

**3. ASEAN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Children**

• **Vietnam’s Status:** As a founding member of ASEAN, Vietnam has endorsed this declaration.  
• Addresses the shoving, all forms of violence including shoving should be eliminated.

**4. ASEAN Commission on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and Children (ACWC)**

• **Vietnam’s Status:** Actively participates in ACWC initiatives as an ASEAN member.

**Where all these commitments apply in society, as well as my concerns**

• **Priority Boarding:** Airports, trains, buses, and immigration services in Vietnam can adopt practices from ASEAN neighbors like Thailand and Singapore to provide priority boarding and seating. This ensures the safety and convenience of pregnant women, children, and elderly individuals, aligning with their rights to special care and consideration.

• **Shoving Pregnant Women:** CEDAW and the ASEAN Declaration emphasize the elimination of violence and discrimination in public spaces.

• **Smoking Around Kids:** Vietnam can strengthen and enforce smoke-free zones in public spaces, especially in areas frequented by children, such as parks, playgrounds, and public transport. These measures align with the CRC and ASEAN commitments to children’s health.

• **Noise Pollution:** CRC highlights the need for environments conducive to children’s well-being and development. Vietnam can implement stricter noise control regulations during nighttime hours, particularly in residential areas, to ensure children and families have a peaceful environment conducive to rest and development.

Remember, Vietnam is an ASEAN member state, they should act in line with common best practices that most ASEAN member states strive for. This is similar to how the EU member states have common best practices.",False,False,0.76,"","2025-01-14 01:52:05","2025-01-15 15:41:24"

One of our favorite trips ever. For those interested in whether or not sex toys are allowed, here is our experience. 

We had done research to know that sex toys are illegal in Vietnam. We also had read here on Reddit that they were not allowed but many people had mentioned they had brought theirs with no problems. In the end we decided to bring a small, cheap vibrator that simply took AA batteries. We removed the batteries and put them in another bag hoping not to attract attention from the scanners. We also placed both the batteries and the vibrator in checked bags. 

All was fine until leaving Tan Son Nhat airport. We had to put our bags through scanners before exiting the airport. They found my wife’s toy and called her over. It was difficult to understand what they wanted as we don’t speak Vietnamese. They used Google translate to tell my wife she was being fined 10,000,000 dong. They then told her since it was her first offense it would only be 4,000,000. We had ordered currency before leaving but it was delayed and didn’t show up in time so we had no cash. They told her there was an ATM machine outside, but after trying it multiple times, it seemed to be out of order. (Others were trying to get cash too but were unsuccessful) She returned multiple times to tell them there was no way to get cash, but they didn’t really seem to care. Eventually they told her the people selling SIM cards could give her cash if she Venmoed (or something similar) them. But they seemed to not even know what she was talking about. After about an hour of frustration, the custom agents just told her we could go if she would just throw it away. We have no idea if this whole thing was just a bribe or really what it was. 

What we learned was while some people have gotten away with it, it definitely wasn’t worth trying for us. The stress, frustration, and time lost was not worth it. We’re not angry at anyone. It’s their laws which they have the right to set and we took a chance.

That being said, our group is a lot smaller than what I have read to be the average wedding in Vietnam. We're looking to have roughly 40 guests and because it would be smaller, we would ideally want to keep it around the 200-275mill VND price for the whole cost of the wedding and dinner (not including accommodations, hotels, flights.) Does this seem achievable? Keeping it in Ho Chi Minh area would mean the guests would have the ability to book their own hotels for as long as they please and make it a trip for themselves.

If there are any recommendations, that would be great. I've heard of a few, such as An Lam Retreat Saigon River (which we've reached out to) as well as Chloe Gallery. Not sure if those are feasible for the small guest count. Any other recommendations would be great.

Unfortunately, the one downside are the Vietnamese.

Ok, before people lose their sh\*t over this being another post about the poor manners of Vietnamese, let me be clear, I really love this country. This is my third winter here and although I have the same gripes as most, I obviously come back for a reason. However, there are some national idiosyncrasies that simply can’t be explained away as “culture”.

The HCMC Metro is a perfect example. In short, although people queued up well, which was a pleasant surprise, as soon as the train doors opened, they rushed to get on. It didn’t matter if there were 10 people waiting or 2, they just charged ahead pushing and shoving. What was disturbing is that these folks didn’t even allow those that wanted off to leave. Unfortunate, the several attendants present simply watched. Seriously, at some point, don’t local VN realize that trains, elevators, etc., are finite spaces and that if you don’t let people get out eventually no one else will be able to get in? Once more lines are open, this is going to be a nightmare during rush hour. I’ve been to many SEA nations with an MRT and yes, it can get a little crazy. However, even during rush hour in Tokyo and Seoul they let people get off before they start their charge.

At the end of the day, I see this as a missed opportunity for the government to educate the population on basic civil behavior. Yes, teaching people patience and civility would be a serious uphill battle, but it would be worth it eventually. Hopefully, Vietnam will come to realize that it can surround itself with the trappings of modernity, like trains, malls, and skyscrapers, but if the general attitude of the populous doesn’t change, it will always be considered a SEA backwater.",False,False,0.82,"","2025-01-13 13:28:02","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Noticing that many of you here need support with messaging girls, over the weekend our team worked together to create an AI to help you with responses.

Super simple - you just need to screenshot the conversation → upload it to the AI → AI provides response suggestions → copy and send it to that person, and you're done.

Just remember to crop out names and avatars from the screenshots to protect their privacy.

My guess is that we don't really have a word in English for this but it's close to 'one' as a posh person might speak.   
  
""One would expect..."" ""One thinks that ...."" ""One should consider ....""

In this archaic use of one you're referring to both the speaker and listener, one = a person like us, or something like that. 

I think Minh is the same here but at what formality should it be used? 

Can I use it with grab drivers? 

Can I use it with my partner? (Vietnamese, she says not...)

Can I use it often in questions, or is it more often used to refer to yourself? i.e. Minh có đói bụng không? (Are you hungry..)

  
Minh seems like a cheat code pronoun we can use that is friendly and appropraite but can I use it with Cô's and Bà's ?  
  
 My assumption is not because pronoun are of create sensitivity in age relations.

Feel free to ignore. (I already left Vietnam before the snarky comments come in. Fully aware that dickheads are everywhere but not talking about them here)

Here's just a couple of the situations in Vietnam where I experienced double standards or selective enforcement of the rules and it annoyed the heck out of me.  

1 - Stopped at a red traffic light while countless locals passed, ignoring it. Light turns green, I go and 50 metres later, CSGT jumps out from behind a tree and singles me out for no reason, completely disregarding the locals who ran the red light. Wouldn't even explain to me what I did wrong as I simply hadn't done anything wrong and they wanted to extort cash. Scum. 

2 - Neighbour kicked off at me for leaving my empty cans by the garbage pile on the street for the recycling lady who came by every other hour. Not a word to the locals who left all the other garbage in the pile or did all kinds of other belligerent behavior. Apparently of all the bad things in Vietnam, a foreigner leaving empty cans for the recycling lady is the worst.

3 - Pool I used to visit had some nonsense rule about no food and alcoholic drinks. There was nothing specified about non-alcoholic drinks. Pool staff would routinely harass and reprimand foreigners for having a can of coke or something despite the fact trying to deal with foreigners would take 10 times as much work for them fumbling around on Google Translate. Meanwhile, locals would be sat there with bowls of pho, snacks and all sorts without a peep from the staff who simply turned a blind eye. 

4 - In my last apartment, locals would regularly take their shirts off in the gym. I did it once when the AC was down and conveniently within 5 minutes of the locals leaving, the security came to scold me like a naughty kid, again choosing specifically to awkwardly fumble around with Google Translate to deal with me rather than deal with the many locals who do the same thing. 

5 - Neighbours in my last apartment complaining because I played video games at normal volume at 9pm. Meanwhile, they'll be blasting music and karaoke into the small hours. 

Anyone else experienced blatant double standards or been singled out on selective enforcement of trivial ""rules"" that irritated you, especially when the ""enforcer"" uses simple plausible deniability like pretending not to notice the locals doing it etc? There really is one rule for them and another for us. 

10k an hour security guards are the worst for it. Nothing gives these people greater joy than flexing the microscopic bit of authority they have over a 6ft2, 200lb foreigner.

I deliberately get attitudey with them and pretend not to understand what they're on about. Go ahead and fumble with that Google Translate. I'll still pretend not to understand. If there's one thing that ticks these people off more than foreigners existing, it's having to actually work for their 10k an hour. ",False,False,0.79,"","2025-01-12 11:55:24","2025-01-12 14:21:48"

-what type of food should i bring? i don’t have a camp stove but i do have a small pot for water or basic food. would you recommend any specific types of food that i can find here?

I wasn’t born or raised in VN and therefore have a tough time distinguishing between these due to how I pronounce them and actually often wonder on the correct spelling, as the appropriate pronunciation would likely help with distinguishing between how they are written. 

I’m curious to know where people/their family are from and how much distinguishing your accent makes between these words?

I am used to paying by card/phone and would be convenient if I can do that in VN too. However I know we refer cash , I still am curious if most of the places can accept NFC payments or not.

I live in Nghệ An, but planning to stay in Hà Nội, Huế, Hội An and Đà Lạt for a while.

I also see that ppl tend to transfer payment through QR codes presented at the shops.

I have VNmese bank account but never used it for purchasing anything so I am a little scared to try it out. I dont think I have a physical bank card though..
Should I download some app in order to be able to use that function?
Zalo?

i have been planning a trip to Vietnam for a while and basically sorted out an 18 day itinerary going from Hanoi to Da Nang. however, i have since realised that there is a limit on bringing dexamphetamine into the country and that id only be able to bring 10 day a worth. ive had a look at the border control policies/procedures and the permit application id need to fill out to be able to bring my medication in in the first place and i can see that they do allow more than 10 days worth of the psychotropic medications in certain cases. 

but from what i understand, even with all of this filled out + a letter from my doctor, it would be up to the border control at the airport as to whether or not i can actually bring more than ten days in? (am i understanding this correctly?) this worries me quite a lot as i am prescribed the stimulants for a sleep disorder and i literally cannot stay awake for more than a couple of hours at a time without them. does anyone know what the likelihood of border control saying that an 18 day supply is okay to bring in? or if getting in contact with the Vietnamese embassy would have any sway in getting border control to let me have them? i think im also just extra worried because the sleep disorder i have (idiopathic hypersomnia) isn’t well-recognised among western countries, so fighting for recognition in SEA feels like a losing battle. should i just cut my losses and plan a smaller trip?

We travel carry on so our bags are always the right size but now both bags have to be under 7 kgs combined and we’re about 12 each.  So we had to pay at the airport to check our carry on bags on our flight to Hanoi. I then saw that our flights while in the region have the same restrictions.

It raises an interesting question: are these jams just a temporary adjustment, or do they point to deeper issues with urban planning? In China, when similar strict measures were introduced, they paired harsh penalties with massive investments in public transport to keep things running smoothly.

Vietnam’s approach seems focused more on enforcement for now—could that create longer-term challenges if public transit options aren’t improved? This article I came across compares Vietnam’s traffic strategy with China’s experience and gives some food for thought on whether Vietnam is heading in the right direction:

I (M24) am from Germany and currently studying in Munich. I now got the opportunity to go study at the USTH in Hanoi during the next winter semster. It was really hard to find a suitable partner university (outside of Europe) due to my field of study (Geoinformatics). Actually I wanted to go to South Korea or Japan. Generally speaking I am interested in visiting Asia and have already been once to Japan before. I am definitely interested in Vietnam aswell, as I think it has a really interesting culture, good food and beautiful landscapes. Also a friend of mine has said that the vietnamese people are very friendly and hospitable. So I was really looking forward to go to Hanoi, until I saw the air quality and read some discussions here on r/VietNam talking about Hanoi being conservative, having bad traffic and being full of smog :/ . A lot of people wrote about Hanoi having terrible air during the winter and outside activities are rarely possible, provided you dont want to harm your health/lungs. And I don't want to harm my lungs generally speaking and also because I had minor problems with asthma in the past. It's far from being serious and here in Germany for the past years I usually didn't have any problems at all, but the air here is fresh and the quality is significatly better than in Hanoi. When I looked up some air quality index for Hanoi it was often classified as ""unhealthy"" for all people. So even if I consider myself as a not-at-risk person, it's still a serious issue, right? Furthermore, I read about people comparing HCMC to Hanoi and pointing out, that HCMC is way more modern and international. Also more people speaking proper english (I can't speak any vietnamese by now, but would soon start to learn some). There is supposed to be more nightlife and generally more things to do, especially as a foreigner. So at this point I am kind of unsure, if Hanoi is maybe not the best choice for an semester abroad. I want to do a lot of activities, be social and also live somewhat comfortable, while of course being healthy.

So how bad really is the air quality? How does it affect you daily live, assuming you try to protect your health to a reasonable extent? Will it be hard for me as an exchange student to experience a lot of social activities (also whithout speaking proper vietnamese)?

I'm currently in the south of Vietnam, specifically in Da Lat. I was planning to travel from the south to the north, but I keep meeting other travelers who have been to the north (Sapa, Ha Giang Loop, etc.) and are advising against going there now due to the complete lack of views (cloudy weather and fog). As a result, I’ve been thinking about postponing this part of Vietnam to February or mid-February, and heading to Laos now for 3-4 weeks.

Additionally, locals are advising against traveling to the north at the moment due to the New Year, which would require better trip planning.

So my question is: first of all, would you advise changing the plan and going to Laos now, then visiting northern Vietnam around early February, or is the weather situation totally random and it really just depends on luck?

I also know that around February the burning off season begins, so I wouldn't want to travel to Laos in March or later.

Lastly... I've been in Vietnam for a week and I'm really surprised by the hospitality of the locals, especially in Da Lat, where I met some incredibly kind people. So to anyone reading this who hasn't been to Vietnam yet... It's definitely worth it!

Surely everyone is looking to spend time traveling during this time, right? Besides Sapa, Ha Giang Loop seems to be one of the most discussed destinations. Therefore, I decided to share my personal experience to help those who are interested in this route. In this article, I will share from A to Z my motorbike journey, along with important notes that anyone should know! :)

# Loop Details:

* **Length:** Approximately 384 kilometers
* **Minimum Completion Time:** 3 days (ideal timeframe: 5-7 days)
* **Road Conditions:** Mostly paved mountain roads with uphill sections and some rough patches. Traffic is generally light.
* **Average altitude**: around 1,000 meters above sea level, with some sections reaching over 1,500 meters.

**Time:** To fully experience the Ha Giang Loop by motorbike, you should spend 5-7 days. If time is limited, the trip can be shortened to 3 days.

**Transportation:**

You have two flexible options:

1. Rent a motorbike in Hanoi and drive yourself to Ha Giang.
2. Take a sleeper bus from Hanoi to Ha Giang, then rent a motorbike there.

Hotels or homestays often help you find a place to rent a motorbike. In addition, you can also buy a used motorbike from backpackers.

* Rent price: 150,000 - 250,000 VND/day (\~6.15 - 10.25 USD).
* Price to buy a used motorbike: 8 - 15 million VND (\~328 - 615 USD).

**Driving License and Road Safety:**

To avoid trouble with the traffic police, make sure you have an International Driving Permit (IDP) if your country is a signatory to the 1968 Vienna Convention. For non-signatory countries (the United States, South Korea, Japan, etc.), the IDP is not valid in Vietnam.

**Note:** In 2025, the fine for traffic violations in Vietnam is very high (running a red light: 5 million VND). If you do not have an IDP, you should hire an ""easy driver"" to drive for you.

**Group size:** The Ha Giang Loop is suitable for small groups (maximum 6 people, 2 people/car). This ensures a smooth journey, easy movement through small roads, and safety when facing container trucks on the road.

**Worthwhile stops:** When traveling independently, you can avoid unnecessary ""added"" destinations like when going on a tour. I will suggest a detailed schedule for you to optimize your time and experience, avoiding fatigue from moving too much.

**Day 1: Ha Giang → Quan Ba ​​(50-60 km)**

Highlights:

* Km 0 milestone: A must-see check-in spot.
* Khuoi My village: A Dao village hidden in the mist.
* Quan Ba ​​Heaven Gate: Cloud hunting in the morning (4-5 am is the ideal time).

Note: The pass road is winding, so pay attention to your driving. You should book a homestay in Quan Ba ​​in advance to avoid running out of space.

**Day 2: Quan Ba ​​→ Dong Van (100 km)**

Highlights:

* Tham Ma slope: Take photos with highland children.
* Yen Minh pine forest: An ideal resting place with delicious and cheap snacks.
* Lung Cam cultural village: Visit ""Pao's House"" and the buckwheat flower field.

**Note:** The road has many sharp turns and gravel, drive carefully.

**Day 3: Dong Van → Lung Cu → Thien Huong**

**Highlights:**

* **Lung Cu Flagpole:** The northernmost peak of Vietnam.
* **Thien Huong Village:** An ancient village over 100 years old, not crowded with tourists.

**Note:** The road to Thien Huong is quite difficult to travel, but worth exploring.

**Day 4:** Dong Van → Nho Que River → Ma Pi Leng → Meo Vac

**Highlights:**

* Nho Que River: Rent a boat to see the scenery (100,000 VND/person).
* Ma Pi Leng Pass: The ""first"" route of the four great mountain passes.

**Note:** The road down to Nho Que River has many sharp turns, pay attention to safety.

**Day 5:** Meo Vac → Ha Giang-> Hanoi

I have studied in Russia between 2006-12 and lived in the US since 2012, with me recently becoming US citizen 5 years ago.

In Summer 2023, I visited Europe (one of many trips), and in Prague, I was biking when three Vietnamese men shouted ""ni hao"" when witnessing me. Once I heard of ""ni hao"", I started approaching them, and even though I recognised that they are Vietnamese straight off the bat, I told them I am a Vietnamese-American tourist. They then told me that their hometown is Hai Phong.

That was in the Prague Centre (close to the Old Town) and despite receiving a lot of Chinese/East Asian tourists, a large bulk of Asians residing in CZ are Vietnamese (fun fact: my father received his Masters in Public Health at Charles University back in 1976).

During the previous day, I rode a bus to TTTM Sapa, and whilst walking to a restaurant, a group of Vietnamese also attempted to speak with me, in Mandarin, even before I uttered a word to them.

I also experienced this in Vietnam last year, where some Vietnamese mistakenly identify me as Chinese.

Even in the US, many Chinese/Cantonese in Boston, Cambridge, and Quincy would greet with me in Mandarin.

Not sure what is going on.

Ironically, even though though father is a prominent Vietnamese dignitary and has been misidentified as Chinese numerous times by passerbys outside of Vietnam, he has a far darker skin complexion than even me (he is darker than many Vietnamese men I met and nearly as dark as Hun Sen, and I have never lightened my skin). Some people even went as far to say that Bac Si Van Quang Tan looks like Xi Jinping.

looking for some advice here where to go or stay during Tết as a tourist since I just found out that it is starting around 25th of January and a lot of things are closed and transportion options could be limited. I'm quite a spontaneous guy so i booked my flight 2 weeks ago and was not doing a lot of research beforehand. I also dont want to do a lot of fixed plans before i come since i have 5 weeks and just wanted to go anywhere it drags me to or i feel like to go. 

I'm arriving on the 16th of January in Hanoi, wanted to stay there for about 4 or 5 days and then see the north or travelling along the coast to the south. Now i think travelling the coast and maybe being stuck in a small village or city whehre everything is closed during Tết isn't my best option. So maybe it would be smarter to go directly to a bigger city like Huế or Hội An? 

Initially i thought about rebooking my flight when i found out about Tết but now im quite excited to see vietnam during this time and see it as a one time chance. I'm a 36 male from europe traveling alone if that matters.

A flight from Vietnam to Malaysia was delayed by an hour after a passenger, who was travelling with her young child, allegedly started screaming after she refused to wear her seatbelt. 

A furious plane passenger caused a one-hour flight delay after allegedly refusing to fasten her seatbelt. Cabin crew members were conducting a safety check prior to take-off when they spotted a woman without her seatbelt on. The passenger, who was reportedly a Vietnamese national, was travelling with her young child at the time. When the flight attendant asked her to put her belt on, the woman allegedly started to protest. The Batik Air flight was scheduled to travel from Vietnam to Malaysia but ended up being delayed by around an hour.

In a video clip of the incident, a woman can be seen shouting at the flight attendant, as other passengers film the argument with their phones. The cabin crew member states: ""Stop yelling at me.""

The passenger replies: ""You’re pointing in my face.""

The attendant stresses: ""This is for safety purposes, not just for you, but also for your child.""

The woman says: ""I don’t care, I don’t have to listen to you.""

According to witnesses, the row caused a delay of around one hour. In the end, police officers allegedly boarded the Boeing 737, and the unruly passenger was escorted off the plane. The other travellers cheered as she left the aircraft, as reported by What's The Jam.

In a second video, viewers can see the flight attendants heading down the aisle as the woman is escorted off the plane. As passengers clap one can be heard joking in the background: ""Stay safe kid. Don't be like your mum please.""",False,False,0.95,"","2025-01-09 23:26:58","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Here are the places I plan on stopping at. Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh. I kind of want to stop in Hue BUT is that pushing too much in two weeks? 

How many days should I spend in each location I’ve listed? I also was interested in doing that Ha Long Bay cruise which was 1 night 2 days. Has anyone done this? Is it worth it? 

What is the best mode of transportation? Should I uber? Take a bus? A train? Or should I just rent a car? I can also fly if that is an option. 

Also when is the best time to visit? I’ve googled and they recommended March or October. I was leaning more towards March maybe summer but I heard it can be BRUTAL.

Any hotels you recommend staying at? I was considering staying in Hanoi and just going to these places but if it’s more efficient to stay where I’m heading I can do that as well.

I'm traveling to Vietnam for 3 weeks to rest, but I actually want to try to revive my literary career.

The novel is about the meeting of a Vietnamese woman and a middle-aged European man - my literary temptation is to write from the first person perspective - the narrator is a girl. (actually one chapter she, the other he - dialogue through that literary form)

I wouldn't need any help to go to the Philippines or other places where more people speak English, but here I need help with the real views of Vietnamese people on Westerners, small cultural details and the like.

So: where can I find a girl who would meet me for coffee one day for an hour, the next day for two hours, the third not at all and so on...

You understand that an escort is not what I need, nor are sexual activities which - as far as I managed to understand - are quite internationalized, understandable and can be translated into literature without anyone's help.

Where to find the right person: a chatty and inspiring ordinary person who is not a tour guide or a person who just charges for company in any sense ...

So for example I am lets say player number 1 and it goes clockwise. If me and player 3 are out of the round but we both have 4 consecutive pairs ie 44556677 and say he has 66778899. And the rules are you have to chop a RED 2 or 2 BLACK 2's. Player 2 plays a black 2 and player 4 plays a red 2 and we're both out of the round already. Can we just keep passing until whoever puts down the chop first? The way I've played it is as long as the round is not over or you can jump in whenever it goes clockwise and gets to your shot. The reason I ask is this, basically I've had a situation where I'm playing and this guy is out of the round, I put a black 2 down and he didn't chop. So I've put my cards down and gone out and suddenly he's gone no wait up i'll jump in to chop and finished before me.

Another scenario is say third and fourth player both have 4 consecutive pairs that's their last 8 cards. Say a red 2 goes down and fourth player wants to chop before third player is that fine or will he have to wait before third passes and it's his turn? I gamble a lot and usually the way is first player gets 2 units second gets 1 unit, third pays second and last pays first. Also if you go out before anyone puts a card down they add up the 2's and chops in their hand. Just wanted to know other peoples thoughts or rules regarding chops, I think the rules are pretty straight forward and don't really contradict each other and i know there are many different rules as long as you declare what type of rules you'll play by.

Well to preface, not only don’t I dye my hair nor have any tattoos, I typically dress up in formal white-collar attire (button down shirt/dress or khaki pants) and I have been obsessed with tech/AI/computer science and STEM in general since childhood and was a few grade levels ahead in STEM subjects. I was even conferred an SB in EECS in 2022 and love to present myself as “refined and fastidious”. My favourite music genre is classical music (inherited this love from my father (75M), who studied in the USSR and Czechoslovakia in the 70s before returning to Vietnam to become Vietnam’s Fauci, and have loved classical music since early childhood). I am also socially liberal and fiscally moderate. My personality dictates that I stand very little chance of dyeing my hair, let alone an unnatural colour. Despite the fact I am not into hair dyeing, I don’t mind others dyeing their hair and I am totally acceptable with it. I also do understand why people dye their hair, and 99.99% of the time, they do so on their own will.

Not my sister however.

I lived with her until we were 16 (2017), first in Vietnam with my parents (75M, 64F, who both never dyed their hair), then in Russia (2006-12) with my uncle-by-marriage (89M) and aunt (87F), and then the US with my oldest sister (35F). At the age of 16 (my senior year of high school), I moved out into my own studio in a college-town and same city where I attended college (where I still live today), and due to the fact I have lived with her for 16 years, I have known a lot about her personality. She is extremely studious, diligent, introverted, polite-mannered, altruistic, and has a refined taste. Until the age of 14, her favourite music genre was also classical music, knew how to play the violin (I knew piano and played numerous Chopin Etudes/Beethoven Sonatas, etc) and during elementary and middle school, despite the fact she was a grade below me (same age as me), she was in a lot of honours/advanced courses. She was converted to K-pop in 2015. I lost contact with her after an altercation at around 18 due to jealousy due to family treating her better than me and viewing me as a black sheep/scapegoat, but during the 18 years of being a close friend, I have discovered one facet about her: She has no interest of dyeing her hair. I even encouraged her to dye her hair for prom and that dyeing her hair is fine, but she seemed to have no interest in it. Hair dyeing is not in her nor my personality.

What incited my jealousy and altercation between my sister was my parents buying her a 1000 sqft single house for 500k in 2019 (heard through a whistleblower, who was my close friend) and later a 1000 sqft condo for 800k in the poshest neighbourhood in 2021. My parents paid 50% of my $1500 per month (at the time) rent between 2017 and 2021, when I sacked them because my investments have garnered from the 5 figures (using my internship and mobile app money from 2018) into the 7 figures due to Tesla, FAANG, and others over the pandemic. My oldest sister owned my bank account in July 2019 and withdrew 5000 USD of my own money (luckily, the other 50k are in my apartment’s safe) from the bank and gave it to my other sister just to buy her a 45k 2019 BMW 330xi rather than a Toyota Camry. By this point, she has not made any money yet and had 8 years of work experience, mostly volunteer work. In 2023, upon graduating college, they upgraded her to a Porsche Taycan. Meanwhile, I purchased a 25k used 2021 Tesla Model 3 last June for 25k using my own money from SW consulting and upgraded from a 225k mi 2016 Toyota RAV4 to save up for an AI startup.

Fast forward to 2020:

Due to the fact my sister is “short” on money (according to my parents, despite them giving 5-6 figures to her every year for food, gas, and essentials), she charged $500 per month for her best friend at college (Cantonese) to live with her as a roommate (she knew of this “friend” since high school in 2017 which motivated her to attend the college). This was during the first month of COVID, when her roommate was evicted from dorm.

Fast forward a few more months into late 2020, my parents communicated with me stating that my sister was coerced into dyeing her hair brown. Her slightly older roommate started dyeing her hair in 2017 (according to my parents). She had no interest in dyeing her hair until then, but she now did, and my parents were kinda discombobulated with this decision as there was no indication she was going to dye her hair.

Then in December 2020, my state started rolling out vaccines (by this time, Vietnam was nowhere near approving any vaccines), and announced that in April 2021, everyone ages 16+ will be eligible for vaccines. Vietnam hadn’t even started any vaccine roll out schedule until about March and from June to September 2021, only the non-FDA vaccines were available (that meant in December 2020, we are not even sure if Vietnamese civilians would even get vaccines in 2021 or not, let alone the Pfizer/Moderna ones). Due to this, my parents have warned my sister to refrain entering Vietnam, due to the risk of COVID, despite the fact the COVID risk was low in 2020 in Vietnam. That was because if the US gets vaccinated in May and none of Vietnam gets vaccinated, my parents (with my father being the President of Vietnam’s DAV and regarded as the Vietnamese Fauci) predicted that the tides will change and the US will become lower-risk during the medium term.

Despite my parents’ and the CDC’s advice, my sister still took the plunge and visited Vietnam knowing that the risk of not getting the best vaccines and being denied entry is on the stakes (she got a green card in 2021, 5 years after me). In case you didn’t know, Phi Nhung, a healthy Vietnamese American idol, died in 2021 due to COVID in Vietnam, and if she stayed in the US, she would have been alive. She booked the tickets in late December, stayed at trai cach ly (many people regarded it as a prison), and arrived around Tet.

Not only did she have poor judgement in arriving in Vietnam in early 2021, she also transferred to a podunk for-profit school which has low job placement rates and high drop out rates (my older cousin dropped out from a similar school in another state after 6 years and 6 years worth of credits without even a bachelor’s degree despite having taken over 128 credits with 250k in debt). My parents urged her to transfer to a semi-prestigious university like BU, NYU, UCSD, UT Austin, UW Seattle, etc, after receiving a 4.0 GPA and acceptance to BU, NYU, and UCSD, stating they will pay the tuition in full but she instead opted for the for profit route.

Due to the fact my parents were infuriated about the roommate and the fact my sister is friends with her (my parents thought she was a terrible influence and that the roommate got my sister to start vaping and making weird noises on camera like an autistic), they advised her to cut ties and they even started to evict the roommate in April 2021 and sold off the house and transferred that equity into an 800k condo closer to school. She lived there alone since 2021 (according to my parents, and I am not even sure of the address).

In the two years since dyeing her hair, she has allowed her roots to grow out (according to pictures) and since 2022, she has kept her hair black, with no intentions of ever dyeing her hair. My parents still have black hair despite their advanced age and none has dyed their hair or has any intention of doing so. My parents told me she sacked all communication with her friend since getting her first full time job in early 2022. My sister even ignored all travel advisories and visited Saint Petersburg Russia in Summer of 2022 on her 3 week trip to Europe which consists of Budapest, Bratislava, Vienna, Prague, Krakow, Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg.

TL;DR: The reason why I am so paranoid about dyeing my hair is due to the fact I am going to Vietnam for Tet (my first Tet celebration in Vietnam since 2006, when I was 52 months), and this heavily resonates to the time my sister went to Vietnam in 2021 for Tet (her first time since 2006 as well). To “save” money for my tech startup whilst also getting a modern apartment which includes a business lounge, I was also looking for apartments in a suburb she used to live when dyeing her hair and which her roommate still purportedly lives (fun fact: I saw her at a Chinese supermarket in that suburb months ago and hence, I still believes she lives there).

Always at reputable places and never any funny business.

First time to Vietnam. First massage was at a 5 star hotel, no funny business but felt pretty exposed as they pulled the single use underware pretty low and messaged pretty low. I'm not shy and didn't mind, though was surprised. I didn't think much of it afterwards.

Second massage, found a place with hundreds of reviews and a total score of 4.9 on Google. Seemed very legit. Went in with a buddy and didn't think anything of it when they assured us we'd get separate rooms.

Attractive massage lady walks me to our room, asks me to remove everything except boxers and lie on the massage table. First action is to pull the boxers down to under the butt cheeks. Literally all the way down. Again, not too fussed about being exposed. She messaged well, but obviously more intimate, the most my cheeks have been massaged in my life... There were other signs like ""accidental"" brushes of the breast, crouching over me and the odd rub as she used her feet to apply pressure, saying I'm good looking etc. But I still thought given my previous Vietnam massage that maybe it was just normal. Towards the end I was on my back and she was getting closer and closer to my crotch until she was touching it with I'm not sure what, hand, arm, accident, on purpose, I couldn't tell because as soon as I lifted my head to ask her to stop she'd moved away. She must have realised as she didn't go back.

The massage ended. I gave her a tip (because it was actually a nice massage even if I was concerned she might be going in a direction I didn't want to go), I went outside and paid.

I guess I'd be naive to believe she wasn't a sex worker. Surely a bit longer and I'd have had an erection followed by a request for a sum to sort it out? She never offered a happy ending, it seemed like a very legit message place and she was insistent I get her name and ask for her on my next massage (even though presumably if she's a sex worker, she wasted her time on me as I was only interested in a massage?). I've had massages in Burma where they really get into every area but are clearly not sexual, so I really don't know what to think.

Chào mọi người!

Mình là Nam, 22 tuổi. Sắp tới mình sẽ về Việt Nam khoảng 1 tháng (từ 13/1 đến 11/2), chủ yếu ở Đà Lạt và Sài Gòn. Đà Lạt thì mình cũng quen rồi, nên lần này muốn dành khám phá Sài Gòn nhiều hơn. Mình đi du học khá sớm, giờ bạn bè ở Việt Nam cũng không còn nhiều, nên hy vọng có thể kết nối với moi nguoi để đi chơi, tám chuyện và trải nghiệm cùng!

Mình là người khá tò mò và hướng ngoại, thích tìm hiểu cái mới. Mấy sở thích của mình thì có đọc sách, hiking, hoặc đơn giản là đi chơi nhẹ nhàng nhưng thỉnh thoảng cũng thích thử một chút gì đó mạo hiểm. Mình cũng rất thích những cuộc nói chuyện sâu sắc, kiểu cùng ngồi tám chuyện về đủ thứ trên đời.

Lần này về, mình muốn hiểu thêm về cuộc sống và suy nghĩ của các bạn trẻ Việt Nam, cũng như khám phá những góc nhìn khác biệt. Nếu bạn biết chỗ nào hay ho ở Sài Gòn – từ quán ăn, quán cà phê, sự kiện, cho đến những hoạt động thú vị – thì chỉ mình với nhé!

Còn nếu bạn rảnh, muốn gặp mặt uống cà phê, đi ăn hoặc khám phá gì đó cùng nhau, thì nhắn mình luôn nha. À, mình nói được cả tiếng Việt lẫn tiếng Anh, nên thoải mái giao tiếp nhé!

I met someone on the street, we discussed a bit and exchange contact in the end, telling me his sister needed to go to my contry and wanted some advice. I hesitate and I say yes (worst choice)
Then tomorow, we decided to meet, I was hesistating and though that I will just skip it, but somehow we met. We took a taxi to go see his family and then we eat together. I then meet his uncle I guess, who is a dealer in casino. We talk about traveling, Vietnam... It was a bit weird but not that much I guess

Then he decided to show me how to play black jack. He teach me the rules and everything. He also show me tricks to cheat there as he will send the cards. Then, at some point a rich chinese girl comes in and she was playing the bank. She just give on the table like 20000$ dollars. And I was saying to myself what the fuck is happening. I was kind of eating two minutes ago and now on a Blackjack table with 20k on the table.
I should have leave but right now my mind was somewhere else. I did not put any money in the end. The uncle advance me like 400$ to play a bit and we start playing. I start to win with his cheat technique but I sorted that something wrong happening. Then, at a moment of the game the chinese girl raise the bet and I needed somehow to borrow money tob
 continue playing as it is needed to reveal the card. I say I have no money and the uncle wanted to take credit. I say that I do not have it, but he start writing the number and give me some tokens. I win all the games until the last one where the girl raise and do a all in. This time I needed to borrow like 20k for him on the paper (by the way the paper is only two row, nothing fancy and not a contract)
And as I did not have the money, and I was winning with a 21 they say that I needed to bring the cash to do the final round. I did not understand it but ok. We put the cars in an envelop. And the girl leave. I was doing the same thing just after telling them that I cannot do anything and that I wanted to leave this place.
I go outside take a motobike with grab and go to my hostel. I am kind of shaking at the moment, still wandering what the hell happened.
They only have my name, my phone and know approximatiy where I leave.
One part of me just want to leave Ho Chi Minh after this and the other telling le that nothing will happend after.
I feel pretty dumb to have put my trust in some random guy and to not have leave when the game started. I hope it will be a good lesson for me that at the beginning if something start to smell bad, I should just leave and that's all.
Hope this post help some traveler as I did not know this kind of scam

PS: For those wondering, even if I think I have the winning hand I will defenitly never seen them again. I think in the end the girl sitted next to me switch my card, with something else. And I think the final scam is to come back with a lot of money for the final round.

I'm Vietnamese-American and I'm trying to help my mom and aunt navigate a property dispute back in the motherland.

\- When my grandfather died decades ago, his will stated that his house would be inherited by his three children (including my mom, aunt, and an uncle who has since died).  All three children were acknowledged as living in the U.S.

\- The will then stated that the power of managing the property would go to his eldest niece (who lives in Vietnam). If at any point, any of his 3 children return to Vietnam to live or do business, the niece would have to return any powers to them, with the stipulation that said person who inherits the house maintains it as an ancestral home and completes yearly ancestral rites.  I am unsure whether that stipulation on ancestral rites implies she doesn't have the right to sell or not.

\- Of the three children, my uncle has passed away. Neither my mom nor my aunt have any interest in claiming the house, now or at any point in the future. This would seemingly result in it going by default to the eldest niece, who was granted management powers. She happens to be a demonic sociopath (and also wealthy, owning numerous other properties). She has two actually decent and poor younger siblings who also live in Vietnam. Both my aunt and my mom would like to give up their power of attorney regarding the property to the younger female niece, so that in any dispute, the three siblings might have to divide it between each other rather than it simply going by default to the eldest with management powers 

The youngest niece got a lawyer (Vietnamese, of course) who told my mom and aunt to submit notarized power of attorney forms IN ENGLISH.  It has been difficult to directly communicate with the lawyer.

I’ve been invited to a wedding in Vietnam, and I could use some advice on what kind of gift would be appropriate. The wedding is between a Vietnamese and a European, so I’m guessing there might be a mix of traditions.

I know cash is a common gift for weddings in Vietnam, but I want to make sure I’m doing it the right way. Should I just bring money in an envelope (and how much is appropriate)? Or would a more personal gift be better since the couple has mixed cultural backgrounds?

If anyone has experience with this or has attended similar weddings, I’d really appreciate your input. I want to respect the culture and also bring something meaningful for the couple.

The local park is small, and it’s a combination of gym equipment as well as an area for people to park scooters which turns into courts in the evening. 

I made the video call (with earbuds) away from people. No one behind me (a pillar) and no one in front of me (a wall). 

The security guy came over and wanted me to leave. I had trouble understanding him, but he spoke a little English and it was clear he wanted me to go. He first asked if I had a scooter (I didn’t). 

I said I would move because I thought maybe he didn’t want me sitting on the ground or near scooters. Not sure why but no big deal to move.

So I moved to the seating area. There was only one person in the park area so I still wasn’t annoying or loud but he came over to me there and asked why I didn’t go. And wanted me to leave from there. 

I’m confused. I’ve been to the park many times, and people sit and talk there often. It’s a public area and I was clearly not filming people (I think it was clear).

It's just that they only require one thing in return. That is I could do anything I want, but I have to do a man's responsibility, which is to get married and have a child. I have to bring a grandchild to my mother

I disagree. I told them if I marry a girl just for people's expectation, I would forever rob that girl of their true love happiness, same thing with me. I couldn't bring myself to ruin someone's else life. A child to be born out of needs to fulfill responsibility definitely will not be raised with love and appreciation.

And if my mother want a grandchild, I could just adopt. There's countless children out there needing a home. I could shelter one, protect one. If I one day decide to adopt a child, then it would be when I will feel best ready and want to, best prepared and thought-out beforehand, not out of a sense of have-to-do or like accidentally impregnated someone and do the moral thing of keeping them though unhappy. And If I couldn't afford to raise an adopted child, I definitely couldn't raise a biological one, nor could I be able to afford weddings and money to take care of both sides of family.

Their reaction was either speechless but with a disapproving face, or said something back along the lines of blood is thicker, they would betray you and other stuffs. Some lashed out calling me crazy, taking a stranger home. People saying stuffs back often are my aunts and uncles, the older generation in general.

Why though?

I miss Việt Nam so much. Requesting advice for learning Southern Vietnamese.","Discussion/Thảo luận",False,44,False,16,"For context, I started writing this at 4:45 AM for me locally. It is now 6 AM... I'm still jetlagged, and I'm returning to work in the morning after taking about 4 weeks off (all unpaid, as I'm currently an intern) 😅

TLDR: It's a massive ADHD ramble, but my family and I visited Southern Việt Nam. I'm supposed to go to work in a few hours, but got a panic attack because I missed Vietnam and now want to learn more Vietnamese because my Vietnamese sucks (as in not fluent enough). I miss the coffee (Highlands Coffee and Trung Nguyên [if anyone in corporate sees this post, either of you two, PLEASE MAKE A US LOCATION, PREFERABLY AT LITTLE SAIGON AT HOUSTON]. I ESPECIALLY MISS YOU TWO), the food, the culture, Saigon Centre, etc. I'm still young and I know that I have more time to see and visit Vietnam more once I graduate from University and make more money. I may go back to Việt Nam sooner than later. Depends on finances.

Requested advice on how to be more fluent in Southern Vietnamese, and mentioned that I'm currently using Duolingo to refresh my vocabulary, despite the dialect difference with Northern Vietnamese (just reading the words in Southern Vietnamese).

My family and I recently went on to a trip to Việt Nam, the motherland in my eyes. I cannot stop thinking about wanting to travel back there again already... It's so bad to the point where I essentially had a very small and mild panic attack and led me to make this discussion post to ease myself before returning to work.

For context for the trip, we started at Sài Gòn (HCMC), and then went on a scenic 10-hour-bus trip to Cà Mau, then Sóc Trăng, then Trà Vinh, and then back to Sài Gòn befoee we had a small tour around Thailand (Pattaya and Bangkok) before going back to Việt Nam to go to Bà Rịa and then finally going back to Sài Gòn before leaving to go back to the US. So overall, I traveled a lot around South Việt Nam. Reason why we went from Cà Mau and went slowly north back to Sài Gòn was because we were traveling to see bridges that we helped (we didn't build the bridges, but my dad helped spread awareness of some of the more dangerous bridges and helped with some donation efforts to build safer bridges, especially in the more rural side of Vietnam so that everyone (especially school children) can travel much more safely.

It also didn't help that it was a trip full of many firsts. For instance, it's my first international trip to Asia, my first time ever in Việt Nam, first time ever on a motorcycle (there are much fewer motorcycles in the US, and I feel that it is more dangerous to be on a motorcycle in the US versus in Việt Nam), first time on a ferry (phà between Sóc Trăng and Trà Vinh), first time meeting extended family, etc. Let's just say that experiencing all of this was a very good high for me, compared to living a student/corporate America life. I especially loved how cozy Bà Rịa was. It's to the point where I'd considering living down there to retire, depending on MANY circumstances. 

But regardless, I love and miss Vietnam. Although I would never want to drive down at Sài Gòn (the only way I can describe Sài Gòn traffic is it's like an organized kamikaze [it really is like you go or you'll never make it to your destination]), I still ironically miss that Sài Gòn traffic. I also miss the relatively affordable food and drinks were, especially the Bạc Xỉu from Highlands Coffee and the Cà Phê Muối from Trung Nguyên. For context, (assuming $1 USD to 25,000 VND conversation) a large coffee in Star Bucks back the states (admitted also too large here) is $6+ (150K+ VND). A large coffee in Việt Nam (albeit with a much more manageable cup size) is at most 61K VND (~$2.44 for Trung Nguyên's Cà Phê Muối). Like, I missed coffee that was really good, balanced, and affordable, especially in terms of US coffee and its pricing. Also, those were the two drinks I was comfortable ordering in Vietnamese, as my Vietnamese cannot even rival a first grader. If there are other drinks I should get from those places, let me know. Also, my family and I skipped out on Phúc Long for no reason other than we saw Highlands and Trung Nguyên first. I also saw that according to Google Gemini that Highlands may make a US-based location... I don't know how true that is... But if it is true, PLEASE MAKE ONE IN LITTLE SAIGON, HOUSTON, TX!!!

Also miss having Xạ Xỉ soda nearly every day. Another thing I'd like to say is that I'm really glad that the Vietnamese food at Việt Nam does match up with the Vietnamese food at my area. Last major thing that I miss (I'm missing a lot here) are ironically the malls (all of the Vincom Plazas and the Go! Mart). Those turned out to be one of my main highlights, as the malls in the US (Texas at least) have one or two floors. I still miss all of the Vincom Plazas there, especially Saigon Centre.

Regarding my mini panic attack, I think it stemmed from my relative lack of Vietnamese, I now heavily regret not relearning Vietnamese when I was younger, as I would've been in much better standing today (I started talking in Vietnamese to my parents when I was a toddler before they had to rush teaching me English, since US-based schools obviously teach in English. It also was the main reason why I pretty much lost all of my Vietnamese at first). With my new-found motivation, I started pickup up the pace on Duolingo to relearn all of the missing vocabulary that I missed and now need to find a way to be more fluent in Vietnamese (the Vietnamese that I currently have is enough to order food and drinks and MAYBE some light small talk [especially with my grandmother], and that's about it). Any tips, tricks, and advice is welcomed regarding how to be more fluent in Vietnamese. I think I saw a post earlier about Learn Vietnamese with Annie or something like that. And for reference, I want to focus on speaking Tiếng Việt Nam Miền Nam (southern Vietnamese or Saigonese), as that's the dialect that we use locally in my area and my family (for more obviously reasons). Will need to learn Northern Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt Nam Miền Bắc), since it's the official dialect (still doesn't change the fact that I liked and am more biased to Southern Vietnamese/Saigonese.) 

I'm now at the point where my nerves have been eased and that I can finally try to sleep again for about an hour before returning to work. If you have read up to this point, thank you so much for listening to my ADHD ramble. Sorry if there are any typos or other grammar issues, as I'm typing this on my phone and Reddit mobile is acting so weird. Not to mention, it is now 5:45 local time for me now that I'm at this part of the post. Anyway, I know that I'm still young and that I have more time to experience Việt Nam later on. I still can't help but miss it and want it now... I'm now at the point where I'm reconsidering joining with a friend to travel all of Vietnam once we graduate from University (despite not having the necessary funds now... I'm also considering taking out a loan if I have to). That or I may tag along with my extended family if they go to Việt Nam again. I seriously went from I need a newer car (2009 Toyota Venza with messed up piston rings with oil-burning issues) to the newer car can wait. Việt Nam now 🤣

Also, notes to myself to when (not if, but when) I return to Việt Nam:

1. Bring toilet paper 
2. Bring hand sanitizer 
3. Bring Albuterol (I have asthma and also saw how bad the air quality was/is in Hà Nội)
4. Bring more SD cards for filming

Edit 1: thank you all for the replies so far! I'll be doing more research on everything later once I get out of work.

I would like:

- group sizes of 30 people or less
- bus transfer from Hanoi
- preferably offers private accommodation along the loop, or at least nicer hostels with hot water

- groups of 50+ 
- overly party focused
- easy drivers who are getting super drunk every night (scared for my safety)
- huge dorms
- headache with the bus transfer to/from Ha Giang

Normally, when I go on holiday, I just get travel insurance from whichever company offers the best deal. However, since I don’t have a return date this time, I’ve decided to take out health insurance in Vietnam instead.

In recent years, Hanoi – the capital of Vietnam – has been ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world. According to reports from environmental organizations, air pollution levels in Hanoi often exceed the safety limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Smog caused by vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and outdoor waste burning has become a familiar sight for city residents.

# The Impact of Pollution on Health and the Environment

Air pollution not only harms human health but also severely affects the natural environment. Respiratory diseases, cardiovascular issues, and lung cancer are on the rise in Hanoi. At the same time, air pollution contributes to climate change, triggering extreme weather events and impacting natural ecosystems.

# The Importance of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions

To mitigate pollution and protect the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential. This not only improves air quality but also helps limit the effects of climate change. A clean environment brings enormous benefits for health, the economy, and society.

# Solution: Promoting the Use of Electric Vehicles

One of the most effective ways to reduce air pollution is to promote the use of electric vehicles, especially electric motorbikes. Here are some reasons and benefits of transitioning to electric transportation:

1. **Reduced Emissions**: Electric vehicles emit no CO2 or fine particles, significantly improving air quality.
2. **Cost Savings**: While the initial cost of purchasing an electric vehicle may be higher, the operating and maintenance costs are lower compared to fossil fuel-powered vehicles.
3. **High Energy Efficiency**: Electric vehicles use energy more efficiently, conserving resources and reducing reliance on oil.
4. **Environmental Friendliness**: When paired with renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, electric vehicles become a fully sustainable transportation solution.

# Steps to Promote Electric Vehicle Use in Hanoi

1. **Policy Support**: The government should introduce supportive policies such as tax reductions, subsidies, or low-interest loans to make it easier for people to switch to electric vehicles.
2. **Infrastructure Development**: Increase the number of public charging stations and develop a clean energy supply system.
3. **Raise Awareness**: Organize media campaigns to educate the public about the benefits of electric vehicles and their positive impact on the environment.
4. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Encourage the involvement of private enterprises in developing technology and producing domestically manufactured electric vehicles.

# Conclusion

Hanoi is facing an air pollution crisis, but this also presents an opportunity for the city to transform and become a hub for sustainable transportation. Promoting the use of electric vehicles not only helps reduce pollution but also paves the way for a greener future for generations to come. We must act today to protect our living environment and build a cleaner, more beautiful Hanoi.

**Hà Nội: Một trong những thành phố ô nhiễm nhất thế giới**



Trong những năm gần đây, Hà Nội – thủ đô của Việt Nam – đã được xếp hạng là một trong những thành phố ô nhiễm nhất trên thế giới. Theo báo cáo từ các tổ chức môi trường, mức độ ô nhiễm không khí tại Hà Nội thường xuyên vượt quá giới hạn an toàn của Tổ chức Y tế Thế giới (WHO). Sương mù ô nhiễm, gây ra bởi khí thải giao thông, công nghiệp, và việc đốt rác ngoài trời, đã trở thành một hình ảnh quen thuộc đối với người dân thành phố.



Tác động của ô nhiễm đến sức khỏe và môi trường



Ô nhiễm không khí không chỉ gây hại cho sức khỏe con người, mà còn ảnh hưởng nghiêm trọng đến môi trường tự nhiên. Các bệnh về đường hô hấp, tim mạch, và ung thư phổi đang gia tăng tại Hà Nội. Đồng thời, ô nhiễm không khí còn góp phần làm biến đổi khí hậu, gây ra những hiện tượng thời tiết cực đoan và ảnh hưởng đến hệ sinh thái tự nhiên.



Tầm quan trọng của việc giảm phát thải khí nhà kính



Để giảm thiểu ô nhiễm và bảo vệ môi trường, việc giảm phát thải khí nhà kính là rất cần thiết. Điều này không chỉ giúp cải thiện chất lượng không khí mà còn góp phần hạn chế tác động của biến đổi khí hậu. Một môi trường trong lành sẽ mang lại lợi ích to lớn về sức khỏe, kinh tế và xã hội.



Giải pháp: Khuyến khích sử dụng xe điện



Một trong những cách hiệu quả để giảm ô nhiễm không khí là thúc đẩy sử dụng xe điện, đặc biệt là xe máy điện. Dưới đây là một số lý do và lợi ích của việc chuyển đổi sang phương tiện giao thông điện:



Giảm khí thải: Xe điện không thải ra khí CO2 hay các hạt bụi mịn, giúp giảm ô nhiễm không khí đáng kể.



Tiết kiệm chi phí: Mặc dù chi phí ban đầu để mua xe điện có thể cao hơn, nhưng chi phí vận hành và bảo dưỡng thấp hơn so với xe sử dụng nhiên liệu hoá thạch.



Hiệu quả năng lượng cao: Xe điện sử dụng năng lượng hiệu quả hơn, giúp tiết kiệm tài nguyên và giảm phụ thuộc vào dầu mỏ.



Thân thiện với môi trường: Khi kết hợp với nguồn năng lượng tái tạo như điện mặt trời hoặc điện gió, xe điện trở thành một giải pháp giao thông hoàn toàn bền vững.



Các bước để thúc đẩy sử dụng xe điện tại Hà Nội



Hỗ trợ chính sách: Chính phủ cần ban hành các chính sách hỗ trợ như giảm thuế, trợ giá, hoặc cung cấp khoản vay ưu đãi để người dân dễ dàng chuyển sang xe điện.



Xây dựng hạ tầng: Tăng cường số lượng trạm sạc điện công cộng và phát triển hệ thống cung cấp năng lượng sạch.



Nâng cao nhận thức: Tổ chức các chiến dịch truyền thông để giáo dục người dân về lợi ích của xe điện và tác động tích cực đến môi trường.



Hợp tác công tư: Khuyến khích sự tham gia của các doanh nghiệp tư nhân trong việc phát triển công nghệ và sản xuất xe điện nội địa.



Kết luận



Hà Nội đang đối mặt với một cuộc khủng hoảng ô nhiễm không khí, nhưng điều này cũng là cơ hội để thành phố chuyển mình và trở thành một trung tâm giao thông bền vững. Việc khuyến khích sử dụng xe điện không chỉ giúp giảm thiểu ô nhiễm mà còn mở ra một tương lai xanh cho thế hệ mai sau. Chúng ta cần hành động ngay hôm nay để bảo vệ môi trường sống và xây dựng một Hà Nội sạch đẹp hơn.

I study art and jewelry making in Australia and got a Master in here for now must be 6 years. I love this job so much, and always feel like staying in Australia can give me so much opportunities. But this job I have is not required  and cannot get a PR in Aussie land. As a result , I have to come back home. Or… spend extra 2 years study a field that I do not like such as preschool teacher or chef… Wop, wop..

So, you can say I am at that point of standing between 2 worlds.

As I study quite well and excell in this field I do, I got awards, exhibitions, residency and I am so afraid of losing all of that when I go back. I am also experiencing the fear of if you going back, you are a “failure”, or have to “ làm trái ngành”. A travesty for me because aside from design or art I don’t know what to do. And also the reverse culture shock, the wage… all of that just collid on me.

But on the other hand, I miss my country, I miss the peple, the food, the culture. Vietnam also on the way up economically and culturally, and I believe in her future so bad that I do not want to miss it. I also noticed that many students study art overseas have also come back and open new galleries and organization that I thought would never be open in Vietnam.

So, as you can see I do not know if this decision to come back is the right one. I think that is the things that feared me the most… You just do not know how it go. The unknown is the most bullshit you have to go through. I read so many posts of many overseas students coming back, some love it, some hate it, some ok with it,…. But to know if it is the right decision you need to be the one who experienced it first hand. But by that it is already been too damm late. I still have so many dreams, so many hungers, so many ambition.

So is this in some way related to deference for men or something very specifically against the wife? I am one of the 2 people mentioned here. 

Edit: adding few more details, neither was yelling or being rude or more pleasant in any way. Both were matter of fact and just getting the work done while managing the kids.

I stick out like a sore thumb because I’m much bigger than a Viet and also notice everyone looking at me possibly because I don’t drive naturally like a Viet and dress differently.

Seeking ANYthing: guidance, advice, contacts, support - anything. 🙏🏽","Discussion/Thảo luận",False,3,False,1,"I am beyond frustrated, depressed, hopeless at this point. I don’t know how much longer I can survive this.

Nearly two years ago, I was in a motorbike accident in Saigon, Vietnam. The accident involved an elderly man who tragically passed away. I was completely sober (tested on the spot and confirmed clean), and there is camera footage showing the accident was not my fault.

The elderly man drove into me. His family later acknowledged he was too old to be driving and was on his way home from the hospital when the accident happened. They have confirmed they would not press charges, and I went to his funeral to pay my respects. Yet, this accident has turned my life into a NIGHTMARE.

The Legal and Visa Nightmare
	•	My visa was denied due to the “ongoing investigation,” and I’ve been banned from leaving the country for almost 2 years.
	•	I have no means to legally rent a home, work, or even stay in a hostel, as I cannot provide a valid visa.
	•	The police took the motorbike I was renting and demanded paperwork from the rental company, which the 'company' has still failed to provide. I’ve heard nothing about the bike since April 2023.
	•	Despite my cooperation, the police give me no updates or guidance. They refuse to issue me documentation to prove my situation.

What I’ve Tried

I have done everything I can think of:
	•	I cooperated fully with the police and asked repeatedly for updates.
	•	I contacted South African Home Affairs (I’m a South African citizen), but they refuse to help beyond basic passport services.
	•	I pleaded with immigration officers, only to be told conflicting information.
	•	I asked the company that sponsored my visa for help, but they refuse because I was not on my way to work when the accident happened. (As was requested once by immigration, so, yet another roadblock!)

No one will help me. The police told me to “go live with friends.” How is that a solution? My family has been supporting me financially, but they are struggling to make ends meet, and I’ve exhausted my savings long ago.

How This Has Destroyed My Life

I have been trapped in Vietnam, unable to move forward with my life, for almost 2 years.
	•	I live in constant fear of being fined or detained because of my expired visa.
	•	I am unable to work legally or rent a home, forcing me to rely on friends and landlords who risk penalties just to help me survive.
	•	My mental health is in shambles—I am severely depressed and feel hopeless.

I feel like I’m being punished for doing the right thing and not giving in to corruption when this began. I’ve tried to remain patient, but I’m at a breaking point.

Please Help Me

I am begging for advice or guidance. If anyone has experienced a similar situation or knows:
	•	How to deal with Vietnamese authorities in a case like this.
	•	A lawyer or organization that can help me get clarity or advocate on my behalf.
	•	Any legal advice on how to resolve this and get my life back.

I’m desperate. I don’t know what else to do, and I feel like I’m running out of time.I’m so desperately trying not to resort to ending my life. 😔

We recently took the sleeping train from Danang to Saigon, and I couldn’t sleep because the smoking area was located right beside our cabin (between the wagons). Usually, when this kind of thing happens, I’m in hostels, and it’s typically other Western foreigners smoking—either on the balcony or somewhere nearby where they’re usually not allowed to smoke. In those cases, I just ask them to move to another spot, and they’re usually okay with it.

Honestly, I don’t know what’s happened to me, but the smell of smoke now makes me feel like throwing up. It’s so strong that it can even wake me up if I’m sleeping.

So my question is—keeping in mind that I know this is probably just a cultural thing—how can I kindly ask a Vietnamese person to smoke somewhere else? I feel really bitchy even asking this question, but I guess it’s okay to ask here. ",False,False,0.27,"","2025-01-06 03:18:18","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

**Here’s a quick summary of the points that stood out to me:**

1. **National Unity and Pride:** The celebrations across cities and towns show how sports achievements can reignite national pride and inspire a sense of collective confidence in the future.
2. **Economic Symbolism:** Just as South Korea, Thailand, and Singapore used sports milestones to showcase their national progress during their growth phases, Vietnam’s win against Thailand mirrors our ambitions not only in sports but also in diplomacy and the economy.
3. **Shifting Regional Dynamics:** Thailand’s football dominance has mirrored its economic success in the past, but recent struggles highlight the risks of stagnation. Vietnam, meanwhile, seems to be at the start of its own rise.
4. **Parallels to Development:** The way our team adapted despite setbacks—like losing Nguyễn Xuân Son mid-game—reflects the resilience needed in our national growth story.
5. **What This Means for ASEAN:** This win reinforces that Vietnam isn’t just catching up—we’re starting to lead, which could prompt other nations to re-evaluate their strategies.

We have planned and researched as much as we can for this trip, but wanted feedback and recommendations on our itinerary.

  
**Day 1-3 (SGN)**

We will be flying into SGN (Tan Son Nhat Int) and will be there for 3 days. We will be staying in a hotel in the Binh Thanh district. Looking into getting the Fast-Track service (only $30 on Klook, which seems worth it if it makes landing less stressful)

Our planned activities are: a tour of the Mekong Delta, the A O Show at the Opera House, water bus tour, and a city bus tour. We’re also excited to try the new Metro.

We plan on visiting the Café Apartments, the Post Office, and the Cathedral.

Recommendations for trendy speakeasies, rooftop bars, and vegetarian/vegetarian-friendly restaurants are highly appreciated.

**Day 4-7 (DAD)**

Taking a morning flight to DAD (Da Nang Int). This leg of the trip is a bit tricky. We will be staying in Da Nang on day 4. We plan on going to Hoi An (which looks like a 30min drive) to meet with the tailor shops for measurements and maximizing the time for making the outfits.

Based on recommendations from this subreddit, we are considering Yaly (on 47 Nguyen Thai Hoc - both locations have 4.9 Google Reviews, but this one has more reviews), Blue Chic, Vanda Tailors, Truong Tailor, A Dong Silk, or Thanh Design.

I’m leaning towards Yaly or Truong Tailor for suits.

We would go to Ba Na Hill the morning of day 5 and stay overnight until day 6. Hoping this will give us time to enjoy the Golden Hand Bridge (early access for guests staying there, right?)  and the Amusement Park. Evening of day 6, we will be heading back to Hoi An. Maybe we can do the lantern or boat ride this night. On day 7, we have the full day in Hoi An and plan on doing the Coconut Boat.

Notable restaurants we would like to visit are Morning Glory, Banh Mi Phuong (heard mix reviews about this place though), and Mot.

**Day 8-10 (HAN)**

On the morning of day 8, we will fly to HAN (Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi). We plan to visit the famous Bun Cha Huong Lien (Anthony Bourdain/Obama) and Tam Vi. We also want to experience the ""train street cafes."" On day 9, we will book a 2-day/1-night Ha Long Bay excursion with hotel pick-up and drop-off.

The companies on Klook we are considering are (Ambassador Signature, Elite of the Seas, La Regina Legend, or Alisa Premier).

Day 10, we complete the Ha Long Bay excursion and return to Ha Noi. We have rest of the evening there. The next morning, we fly out of HAN.  

***Miscellaneous***

For phone/internet service, I have T-Mobile which should provide limited service. However, I will also be getting additional E-Sim for Data. I heard Airalo is good?

For cash, I plan on ordering some VND currency from the bank before flying out. I will also bring USD for  exchange at Gold stores (heard that larger bills get better rates, like $50s or $100s?). Ideally, we are hoping to pay as much as we can using credit cards, but it seems that most of Vietnam use cash.

For Medication, we plan on packing plenty of sunscreen and bug spray. I also plan on pre-treating clothing with Permethrin. Also, we will be packing Imodium and Pepto-Bismol. Maybe some prescriptions for stomach problems as well. I’m most worry about getting some sort of stomach bug and derailing our trip.

For our E-Visa, we completed the application. We plan on bringing passport photos in case we need to do a visa-on-arrival.

I think that’s it right? Am I missing anything else lol

I am seeking advice from people that have found relationships or ended up getting married that are cross-cultural/cross-ethnicity different countries.  Particularity people that have met through international dating apps and not initially in person.  
  
I am a (36M) from North America that has met this beautiful, spirited, energetic, successful (30F) women from Vietnam. We have been texting pretty much everyday and have had a couple of face time calls. 

It has been challenging to communicate and to have more face time since we have a 12 hour clock difference, as well as each having busy lives.

I would like to know how people that currently/or had had long distance relationship made it work?

I really, really like her and would like to try to make by best attempt to start and have a relationship with her.

The other issue is about cultural/relationship goals. She is looking to get married, but has mentioned hesitancy of moving away from Vietnam, since she has everything she needs there. I respect her love and patriotic nature for her homeland and would never pressure into moving away. I would definitely consider moving there if money was not a problem. But I do not think I could be an adequate provider or provide the same level of comfort if she did decide to move to NA.

For those who have been in this situation, how was this handled? What comprises were made?

My other question is about pursuing/dating each other.  
  
I know that she definitely serious about finding a husband, but I am not sure if she is seriously considering me as an option. I am assuming that if she is still texting/ face timing me; she is interested. I have made many flirty comments and some teases, but I don't know if she took them seriously. I am very serious in wanting to get to know her more and date her, but I sometimes feel that maybe she does not feel as serious? She is not really too proactive in asking many questions about myself, and I tend to lead text and facetime conversations. Is that a lack of interest on her part? She seemed more proactive when we did facetime and initiated some of the calls, so there has to be some level of interest there right?  
  
In the western world, dating moves really fast. What expectations should I have with this women? is dating slower here? Its hard to read her intentions and her interest level. Any advice on this?

Since we are so fare away from each other and have a 12 hour difference, What does dating even look like?, especially since we never met in person,  This is foreign territory to me and would love to get advice on this.

  
Should I be making an effort in going to Vietnam to meet her as soon as I can to see if we click?  
  
I know this will sound batshit crazy, but I definitely could see myself marrying her and having a future with her. 

Anyways, I know this is a long post. I appreciate and welcome all advice and feedback.

Thanks for your time.

I understand that tap water shouldn’t be consumed, which is why I avoid it.

Over the past few days, I’ve experienced mild stomach pain and am trying to identify the cause by eliminating potential factors.

The pain has occurred only after drinking from a Viva-branded water can, which I purchased myself. The can was new, but like most water cans, it may have been recycled, refilled, and sealed again.

Could this be the reason for my stomach discomfort, or are these cans generally safe to drink from?

I bought the water from a small shop that specializes exclusively in selling these cans. If they were selling contaminated water and customers found out, it would likely jeopardize their business.

Thank you for your insight.

Line Skys Rooftop Bar, absolutely great for seeing aircraft taxi to Runway 25 left, and close up view of aircraft. Sadly this shop is temporarily closed, so other option is Cathay Coffee, which gives you a little bit of the ramp, but not a lot.

Next up is LAVA Coffee, really good place to see it up and close, for any arrivals coming in for 25R. Drinks over at the shop is good price, and taste nice. Although Katinat at 50 Quang Trung street ain’t too bad but… prices ain’t cheap there.

Cafe Ngắm Máy Bay, 389 Quang Trung.
Absolutely great view of the airport and ramp, drinks are okay, but you also got a nice collection of model planes to view at. But bring mosquito repellent for that spot since there is mosquito sometimes. Although that spot get backlight during the morning, so afternoon shots are great.

Lastly the closest to see an aircraft.
Is hương cao nguyên sky view at 55 Phạm Văn Bạch, this spot is hard to get there by car, so use grab bike. But solid and amazing view of aircraft insanely up close. Although it works best in afternoon and if operations change to Runway 07

Like I said, these are the spots I used the most. I ain’t gatekeeping things, but if you want to have coffee with a tiny hint of Jet A1, then that’s the spots.

Travelling to Vietnam in early March to stay until early April. I was looking into the idea of doing a motorcycle tour from Hanoi to HCMC.

I breathe live music and as im mostly quite introverted person, live music is often the only easy way for me to connect with like minded people. 

I´m moving in all kind of music genres. From some authentic folk-music to head-banging sludge-metal, from chill ambient to bone-breaking dnb. And everything inbetween. 

Looking for any recommendations where to go and what to do. A whole festival would be ideal but im open for concerts, open stages, jam sessions or any other recommendations as well. 

 Also, since this will be my first time in Vietnam (or this part of the world in general) would be very thankful for any cautions or warnings too.

Firstly, Vietnam is an amazing country and we will definately be coming back in the future so overall it was an amazing holiday. I'll recap the holiday below for future holiday makers going to Vietnam for their use.

Ho Chi Minh City. Amazing city. Stayed at Rivergate apartments. Pretty good accomodation with sufficient living space. There are a lot of other short stayers here and the ""host"" needs to give you access to the pool, because the building isn't supposed to be used as short stay acommodation, which is annoying. There is food and coffee in the alley street next and behind the apartment which makes breakfast easy. The Dong Tay Barber shop around the corner is also amazing for men's barber cuts. Best hair cut and service for $80k dong plus tip.

HCMC has a lot of shopping centres with indoor play centres which you pay per kid. This was handy for the kids we had with us as it kept them occupied for a while.

Food to try is Banh Mi, Bun Bo Hue, Cafe sua da, Bo Ne, Bánh Xèo. The Cafe sua Da is the best kick in the morning. . You can also just order Banh Mi with (deep) fried eggs for breakfast.  Lots of other food to try as well which is why just walking the streets and eating like a local is such an enjoyable experience. Pricing is unbelievably cheap. Fresh Juices go down well when you have been walking around in the humidity and heat. 

Ben Thanh Markets - Food inside is great but shopping is also decent too., numerous shopping centres. 

War Museum  - bit confronting but that's the reality of war, but it was still interesting to walk and read about it.

Presedential palace - interesting and quite vast especially in the basement. Locals and tourists take a lot of pictures there but it isn't too overcrowded.

Ben Nghe Street Food, down the road from the Presidential Palace has a good selection of food and juices to have after doing Presidential palace.

the Post Office. Interesting but not mind blowing. People bought post cards to send it back to their home country. The Church opposite was decked out in Xmas lights which was nice. 

Flew to Phu Quoc island for a few days.

We stayed at the Wyndham Garden Grandworld. (45min from the Intl' airport). Accommodation was clean and in good condition but they couldn't offer us one of our adjoining rooms so there was a bit of room shuffling after the 1st day to get it to work. The big water slides are not working even tho they are advertised. Rumour was it wasn't certified yet. There is a kids water feature but adults weren't allowed to go up which is odd. 

In general Phu Quoc has a Resort area which is to the North West of the island is a bit of a ghost town. The buildings are all european inspired which i find a bit odd and 80% of the shops are empty. only the shops around the main lake were busy at night. during the day when it is quite warm, noone is out. Bit sad to see a large area of this natural island cleared for a ghost town.

We visited Vinwonders, which is like a Disneyland, Water park, Aquarium and more, stuffed into one Theme park. We didn't even have enough time to do the whole Theme park. We hit some rides for the kids, then got a buffet lunch, then the aquarium which is inside a huge turtle building which was pretty cool then spent the afternoon at the water park. We prob only explored 50% of the park. It is pretty quiet so there were no queues for rides or very short wait times if there was a queue. We would come back in the future to hit Vinwonders again maybe over a couple of days. One thing to note is that Adults aren't allowed on the kids water splash area and slides in the water park, not even to walk kids up, even tho the structure is huge and could easily take several adults. Some i would consider adult slides. Also 140cm seems to be the limit for rides. Under 140cm ur a child and above is an adult. Consider this for tickets and rides. Another factor is Weight. They WILL weigh you on a scale to check your actual weight for the ride. Tickets were like $50aud per person so it really is bang for your buck. If you can't get to Disneyland, this is probably close enough.

The food in this resort part of Phu Quoc is very limited and probably overpriced. Tourists are the main target so it is priced accordingly. Tourists are mainly Russians, Khazakstans, Koreans and Japanese i think. There is no traffic here except the odd scooter and car, which adds to the ghost town description.

The beach was nice. The beach faces the west so the it can be pretty toasty in the afternoon. i recommend going in the morning as the trees will provide shade on the shore line.

We went to the Phu Quoc night market once and it was much nicer and livlier. Got dinner, dessert and drinks there and was priced more locally.

We hit the Vinsafari another day. Also another worthy attraction. enjoyed walking around looking at the exhibits. The Safari bus is also pretty good as you get to see grazing animals, tigers and bears. The condiitons of the enclosures were decent and i think the animals looked healthy enough.  In the Crocodile area, i think i noted a few dead crocodiles in the enclosure however. Also a big pet peeve were tourists feeding the monkeys and otters, next to the don't feed the animals.  There wasn't any staff in these areas. Overall it is worth checking out.

Flew to Hanoi after Phu Quoc. Hanoi is smoggy so bring masks. I personally didn't think the food in general was great here. nothing blew my mind. The food is different to the south in HCMC. However some food highlights are the egg coffee which is quite rich, coconut coffee & Banh cuon. 

Hanoi was also where we hit our first major issue. We booked, via [booking.com](http://booking.com), to stay at the Gatsby Central Hanoi Hotel. We wanted to check the rooms before paying full upfront payment to them. There was a disagreement about doing this but eventually they let us view the rooms. They also wanted us to cancel the [booking.com](http://booking.com) booking and just pay them cash direct for the full stay which didn't go down well. we were also missing an extra bed if we did stay. An argument was had and luckily we had a few native vietnamese speakers with us. The condition of the rooms was run down. The pics you see on the websites were the original photos from when they probably first built it. Everything is worn down. The bathroom tiles have large cracks in them. It did not look like the sink had been wiped down in a while. It is a bit of a bait and switch and try and get you to pay upfront with no recourse so just be careful.

We only stayed a night there because it was 10pm when we actually rocked up because of Vietjet delays (more about Vietjet later). We moved to Rose Garden Apartments which was further out but they were 1000x better and were serviced apartments so we had a living room and kitchen and dining table, unlike the Gatsby, which was just the main room with beds and a bathroom. So i can recommend Rose Garden apartments. There is local food around but not as much. Grab is your friend here to get back into Old Quarters.

We visited Hanoi Sky, but with the smog, you can't see exceptionally far. 

We checked out Toy street, but it didn't have as many stores as we thought. 

Shopping in general on the streets is actually pretty good. Picked up a couple of back packs and shoes for a great price. The shops north of the Ho Hoan Kiem were where we hit.

I did a foot massage with my partner in Hanoi. They advertised a price at the door 220k for 60min or something like that each. No issues did the massage and at the end the masseuses asked for tips. So this was a bit awkward as it wasn't mentioned at the door. So be aware some places ask for tips and some places don't so just be upfront at the start.

Hit a few shopping centres so the kids could go into the indoor play centres. Entertains them while the adults can do a few laps of the shops.

We also got some FRESH Salted egg Kopi bread just as it came out of the oven on the streets at the south end of Toy Street. AMAZINGGGG. there are other flavours like vanilla and mochi etc. So addictive. There are two stores, King Roti and another one just 2 shops up. check them out.

We hit Train St to do the tourist thing and wait for a train to come past. Firstly , you need to find out what times the trains come so you go before they arrive of course. Secondly, for you to view the train while it goes past you need to sit down and the vendors know this so you will have to buy a drink to sit at their chairs, which is fair enough. Get their early enough so you can walk along the tracks to choose a vendor you want to sit down before it becomes too late. Prices are slightly more but nothing crazy. We also got the freshest Banh Cuon as we were walking towards train st. This lady made them infront of us while we waited.

Checked out Book St. Interesting. Few photo opportunities here.

We wanted to check out Ha Long bay so you hav to book via a booking agent on the street. This is where we hit our next issue. The travel agent (who is located next to the Crepe store at the north end of Ho Hoan Kiem) showed us a glossy picture book of the Halong Heritage Luxury Cruise boat which would take us on the Ha Long cruise. Looked great and nice. The receipt/invoice did not note down the name of the boat. She called the tour guide to confirm and it was all good. We paid cash and it was all sorted. We also took our own private bus/taxi there. The next day our driver took us to the Jetty (2hr drive plus a stop off) where our boat was supposed to be. A person came out and confirmed who we were and said that is your boat. and we were like no, we are on the Halong Heritage. And he just stared blankly and said its the same. This boat was called Halong Sonata and looked different. We called the travel agent and she said ""the Jacuzzi is broken. This boat is the same"". The old bait and switch scam. The Sonata was fine. It was in good condition but it wasn't what we were sold. So be careful of the bait and switch on tours.

Halong bay cruise it self was fine however overcrowded. They will Jam as many boats and tourists on to the boats and islands as they can. the boats literally will squeeze inbetween other boats to dock so you can get back on to it. It is a constant queue of people. Suprising cave is just a queue at the start and spreads out a little as you get further into the cave. The Kayak and boating is just a hundreds of tourists trying to jump onto kayaks or the row boats. It moves quickly but there is a bit of queue cutting and shoving to get onto a kayak or rowboat. The whole feels is a bit over touristy and commerialised which is unfortunate. We did it, but wouldn't do it again. 

After Hanoi, we flew to DaNang. Overall it is an amazing city, unfortunately it was raining for most of the time. We hit Ba Na Hills and took the cable car up. The cable car system it self is amazing and as an engineer, quite amazed at how they built everything into the mountains. Unfortunately due to the rain, we essentially just moved into a cloud so our visibility eventually dropped to like 20m. We walked around the Ba Na hills but everything was wet, we couldn't even see the buildings so couldn't actually follow a map because we couldn't find reference points. oh well. We eventually got to the Golden hand bridge and took a few happy snaps in the clouds. The Castle is incredible that they built something like that in the mountain. I would go back just on better weather.

DaNang city itself is great. The Massages are even cheaper and INCLUDE a tip in the price so me and my partner did a 90min massage was awesome. The night market was really good

The dragon bridge and the fire and water show is worth waiting for. We waited in the rain!. 

We would go back and check out DaNang again in better weather. The beach was rough due to the wet weather and storms but they would entertain the kids if the weather was nicer.

We also did a trip to HoiAn to do the Coconut boats. That was a bit of a waste. The coconut boats was interesting. They take you out to an opening where there are other people that spin really fast and ask if you want to try. Also they expect a tip just for showing you how they spin really fast in a circle. Then the coconut boat rower takes you to a old men singing karaoke in coconut boats...it is def the most WTF moment. Then you are supposed to tip this old man who sings out of tune. WTF.  Would have prefered if they showed more traditional things like fishing and crab pot pulling or something. The coconut boat is relaxing except for the ""entertainment"" above.

We also visited a Japanese water park in Da Nang called Mikazuki Water Park 365. Pretty awesome as it is themed towards the Japanese so it is very clean and well maintained. There is a tide pool, a couple water slides and a water roller coaster. Also a lazy lake. Upstairs there is an outdoor Onsen which is AWESOME. The water rollercoaster is also a highlight but you HAVE to be 40kg. they will weigh you here. The tube slides only need ot be 30kg. You could spend a day here. Bring snacks as the food area is limited and very slow.

We also visited Hoi an for the night laterns. It was raining so wasn't great to walk around in ponchos. It was pretty and worth visiting for a few photos. The night market is decent with food options too.

That pretty much wraps up all the places we visited. 

We took Vietjet for our internal flights. Vietjet are a budget air line and it shows. Delays are pretty much certain and there won't be any communication abou the delay. The screens will say boarding but noone will be there for boarding. They will also park the plane at the end of the airport and shuttle you to the terminal which can be pretty average as you have to wait and sardined into the shuttle bus. Also when you are delayed, there is no one at the gate to tell you what is going on which i think is on purpose. They only rock up when boarding is about to start. It is a total shtshow. You can waste half a day essentially because of the delays as you will get to the airport early for the normal boarding but will get delayed another 2hrs or more while ur already waiting and checked in. Anyways done with my Rant. They are a budget airline so you get what you pay for.

Vietnam Airlines, which is what we took between Perth and HCMC, was great. Full service with entertainment screens. People at the gates to explain if there are any issues etc.

Other things to note while in Vietnam. Traffic is nuts, however it is organised chaos. Traffic just flows. If you need to cross a road, wait for a gap between the cars then start crossing at a smooth and constant speed. Just look towards the oncoming scooters but keep moving forward. They will avoid you if they know where you are going. Do not stop and you will be fine.

Think that is my wrap up of Vietnam. We would be going back in the future to hit HCMC, Phu Quoc and DaNang/Hoi An again.

Hopefully it helps fellow travellers to Vietnam. Amazing country, people and food!

Lately there is a trend in Indonesian social media about comparison between Indonesia and Vietnam. One of them is this infographic regarding government comparison and foreign investment.

The infographic originally in Indonesian, but I've translated it to English. So this infographic comparing anti-corruption law, government efficiency, and foreign investment. Usually when this data is posted among Indonesian social media, it is usually accompanied with criticism towards Indonesian government (this kind of posts usually posted by opposition side to attack ruling government).

One of the highlighted difference between Indonesia and Vietnam, is regarding Apple investment.

For those who don't know, previously Indonesian government banned sales of iPhone 16 here (but usage of it is allowed), until Apple made investment in Indonesia. Indonesian media then highlighted stark contrast of Apple investment in Indonesia and Vietnam, where in Vietnam it is tens of billions of USD, while Indonesia only recently got 1B USD. Usually when there is discussion about it in Indonesian social media, they will usually says that the main cause is investment is easier because centralized autocratic but efficient government, and because Apple was given 50 years worth of tax holiday, something that Indonesia can't do due to its already low tax ratio. Some opposition influencer in Indonesia (especially in IG and Twitter) even hailing Vietnam as some kind of dream country.

There is also discussion on [Indonesian subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/1hruhlc/pertandingan_data_dengan_vietnam/) about this, but it is in Indonesian. I'll try to sum it up here on why Vietnam got a lot of investments according to that thread:

1. Every investment goes only to central government. Indonesian government is decentralized, multilayered, and corrupt, so there are a lot of bribes and hurdles.
2. Vietnam is located right next to China. In the event where foreign factories are fleeing from China, they can just move to Vietnam as neighboring country
3. Political condition is much more stable because of centralized communist government. Also less corruption because corruptors got death penalty
4. Labor is cheaper than Indonesia
5. Vietnam has good education
6. Lax taxation policy for investors

But all of these discussions are from Indonesian POV, so we would like to know from Vietnamese POV.

1. Are those point above from Indonesian POV true?

I'm a big leftist and very interested in comunism, I found while visiting Vietnam that 2 of the guides I met where very critical of comunism and the government, which I didn't expect. They sayed stuff like:
- what they can't control, they forbid
- the only communist thing here is the name of the party (as a positive)
-we have to pay for school and healthcare
-doctors and government workers are very badly paid and often have to have multiple jobs
-Vietnam has a plan to privatize 99% of the economy by the next year (I don't even think this is true)
-young people are scared to talk about politics online because the government would hunt you down (this one is from my friends girlfriend, not a guide)

What do you guys think? This is very different to the image I had of Vietnam through watching Luna oi's YouTube channel, and honestly I'm inclined to believe her since she always presents so many sources and I just visited as a tourist. But what incentive do the guides have for lying to us?

I had a young  guide from da Nang who studied in Cuba and China and was a software engineer. He spoke Spanish. Same as the guide from HCM. It shoked me that this second guide was about 75 years old and she wasn't retired, she was originally from Hanoi and studied in Cuba as well, she spoke Spanish and was honestly the sweetest old lady ever.

My friends girlfriend studied in England and spoke English and a bit of Spanish because of my friend + she was taking classes now.

Please don't be very harsh with me in the comments 🙏 I know this is a hot topic but I'm just looking for an amicable discussion and to learn more about this beautiful country, last thing I want is an argument.

Lastly, anyone's interested in a long distance friendship with someone from Spain? I would love to learn more about Vietnam and I'm also trying to learn the language. + Im more than happy to talk about things from Spain and compare!

This post is quite detailed, and it's divided into two main sections: a day-by-day travelogue of our 22-day adventure, followed by our general observations on the experience (including cost, SIM cards, food, weather, etc.).

**TLDR:**

* **Ho Chi Minh City** (4 nights)  
* **Nha Trang** (3 nights)  
* **Hoi An** (3 nights)  
* **Hue** (1 night in train)  
* **Ninh Binh** (2 nights)  
* **Ha Giang** (2 nights in the bus, 2 nights on the loop)  
* **Hanoi** (4 nights)

**Adjusting the length**

* Longer: I would add Sapa and Da Lat  
* Shorter: I would change Ninh Binh to 1 day trip from Hanoi and skip Nha Trang \= 16 nights

**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**  
**22 DAYS IN VIETNAM**  
**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**

**Day 1 (✈ → Ho Chi Minh City)**: We landed in Ho Chi Minh City in the early afternoon. The immigration line took around an hour. After checking into our hotel, we took a much-needed nap to recover from the long flights. In the evening, we ventured out for our first taste of Vietnamese cuisine, savoring delicious bowls of Pho, before taking a stroll through the city center.

**Day 2 (HCMH)**: We enjoyed a leisurely morning, sleeping in before heading out for a late breakfast of Bo Ne. In the afternoon, we embarked on a city tour with **HotPot Saigon** (a student-led organization) that provided an introduction to the city's landmarks. We visited the **Independence Palace**, the **Notre Dame Cathedral**, and the **Central Post Office**, also walking past the grand **Opera House**. The tour concluded with coffee at the unique 42 Nguyen Hue Street **Coffee Apartments**. Later that evening, we spontaneously decided to attend the **AO Show** at the Opera House, purchasing tickets right then and there. The show itself lasted an hour, and while we enjoyed it, we felt the price was a bit steep for the short duration (with the cheapest tickets at 800k VND).

**Day 3 (Cu Chi Tunnels and Mekong Delta):** Today was a full day of exploration, starting with a visit to the tunnels – a truly worthwhile experience. We opted for the optional activity of shooting a gun, which, while thrilling, was quite expensive (10 seconds of shooting cost 600k VND). After a provided lunch, we continued our journey to the Mekong River Delta. This visit was packed with experiences, including a boat ride on the river, a demonstration of coconut candy making, a chance to hold a snake (and tasting of a snake wine), a visit to bee farms with samples of their honey, a lovely performance by local singers, and finally, a peaceful boat ride through a small creek. I would recommend this tour; it's a fantastic day out, and includes many optional food tastings along the way.

**Day 4 (HCMH)**: Today, we visited the **War Remnants Museum**. While the visit was interesting, the largest part of the exhibit is a photo gallery. We also took care of some essential travel tasks: doing laundry (we definitely underestimated how many t-shirts we'd need each day\! – we went through 2 shirts per day due to hot and humid weather) and exchanged cash (we found the exchange rate to be better than what Google indicated). In the evening, we joined another tour with HotPot Saigon – **Food Tour**. This was a very enjoyable and relaxed experience, however, it might not be ideal for those very concerned about food hygiene – while it wasn’t terrible, it's important to remember that this is Vietnam. Perhaps letting them know about any specific dietary preferences or concerns in advance would be a good idea.

**Day 5 (**✈**→ Nha Trang):** We arrived in Nha Trang in mid-December, a time when the weather is typically quite dry. However, we seemed to have struck a bit of bad luck, with almost the entire month's worth of December rain falling during our three days here\! This meant the sea wasn't ideal for swimming; the water was murky brown from the mud carried down by the rivers. It's also worth noting that the airport is located a bit outside the city, requiring a roughly 50-minute taxi ride (costing around 360k VND). Once we arrived and settled in, we headed out for a bite to eat and then visited the impressive **Cathedral** and the serene **Long Son Pagoda**. A quick tip for temple visits: remember to cover your knees and shoulders, as you won’t be allowed to enter otherwise.

**Day 6 (Nha Trang):** Despite the truly awful weather – wind and rain – we decided to proceed with our booked **snorkeling tour** through Vuongland Travel (for 500k VND). Our guide was fantastic, and due to the adverse weather conditions, our tour was shortened a bit (with everyone's agreement). We ended up skipping one of the scheduled islands. Our first stop was supposed to be a vibrant coral reef, but unfortunately, the underwater visibility was too poor for us to see anything. Next, we visited a rocky beach, teeming with a variety of colorful fish that were a delight to watch. Our third stop was for swimming only (no snorkeling), after which we were served lunch on the boat. It's worth noting that the boat was quite basic, lacking the kind of luxuries we saw on other boats (some even had inflatable slides\!). Our boat didn't offer much in the way of protection from the wind or waves, although it did have a roof. Overall, considering our worries about being stuck in the hotel all day, this tour was definitely a worthwhile experience. In the afternoon, we explored the ancient **Ponagar Temple**, where they thoughtfully provide clothing free of charge for visitors needing appropriate coverage.

**Day 7 (Nha Trang):** Today, we decided to visit **VinWonders Nha Trang**. Unfortunately, the persistent rain meant that many of the park's most popular attractions remained closed all day, even though it was only drizzling in the afternoon. This included the cable car, zipline, ferris wheel, and one of the main rides in the amusement park. On the plus side, the park was practically empty, though this meant we had limited options beyond the waterpark. One of the highlights of our visit was the opportunity to **feed the giraffes and deers**, which was surprisingly fun (each encounter cost 40k VND). Overall, we spent the entire day in the park, but in retrospect, we felt that our time could have been better utilized elsewhere.

**Day 8 (✈ → Da Nang, 🚕 → Hoi An)**: After arriving in Da Nang, we decided to spend the afternoon exploring the **Marble Mountains**. I recommend visiting this site; the caves are truly beautiful and unique. We conveniently stored our luggage at the restaurant where we had lunch, which was located close to the entrance but just off the main street. The entrance fee to explore the hills and caves cost 40k VND, plus an additional 20k VND for one more cave. We spent a solid 2.5 to 3 hours here, thoroughly exploring every nook and cranny. It's worth noting that this isn’t a leisurely stroll or a challenging hike; it’s somewhere in between. After our adventure at the mountains, we simply took a Grab taxi to our hotel in Hoi An.

We arrived in Hoi An the day after the floods had receded. From what we gathered, these floods are a fairly regular occurrence, happening anywhere from two to nine times each rainy season. Typically, only certain streets in the old town are affected, and fortunately, the waters usually subside within one or two days – which was indeed the case for our visit.

That evening, we ventured out to explore the **night markets**, enjoyed a delicious dinner, and also took a relaxing 20-minute **lantern boat ride** (costing 170k VND). We did, however, fall victim to a common tourist trap and ended up paying 50k VND for a floating lantern, which we later learned should only cost around 5-10k VND. This was a valuable lesson for us, as we hadn't needed to haggle much before and were simply caught off guard.

**Day 9 (Hoi An)**: We began our day with a 2.5-hour free (tip-based) **walking tour of the city**, a great way to get acquainted with Hoi An's charm. After the tour, we strolled over to the bustling central market, where we were approached by a friendly lady advertising her **tailor shop**. Although we had a few pre-selected tailor shops in mind, we were drawn to her shop in the market, as they offered fair prices from the start. In the end, we decided to have our clothes made there and ordered two pairs of men's pants (one pair was even completed on the same day\!), one pair of women’s pants, one pair of women’s shorts, and a dress, all for a total of **160 USD**. My partner didn’t require any alterations to his pants. However, I ended up making two additional trips the next day, first to try on my clothes and **make adjustments**, and then again to pick everything up. Overall, the experience was positive. The prices were reasonable, and the ladies were lovely, with a touch of traditional Vietnamese charm. We did note, however, that they didn't seem to carry heavier fabrics suitable for European winters, and I wasn't entirely sure about the fabric information they provided. For me, the extra fittings and adjustments were essential, as the dress and pants were initially too tight, and the shorts needed deeper pockets. For the shorts, I simply provided images for them to recreate. As many others recommend, it's wise to **come prepared with a clear idea of what you want**, otherwise it can become overwhelming and result in wasted time and money.

**Day 10 (Hoi An)**: On this day, we embarked on a half-day tour to **My Son Sanctuary**. This historical site is filled with partially ruined temples and religious structures, remnants of a civilization that thrived in the area before the Vietnamese. The tour itself was very enjoyable and well-paced, allowing us to return to Hoi An in plenty of time for our tailor fittings, as well as some leisurely walks through the charming city.

**Day 11 (🚌 → Hue, 🚂 → Ninh Binh)**: Today was primarily a travel day, but we made sure to maximize our time with some **sightseeing in Hue**. We had booked a train from Hue to Ninh Binh for the evening, and so needed to first travel from Hoi An to Hue. There are a couple of different ways to reach Hue from Hoi An: you can take a train from Da Nang, or there are bus options directly from Hoi An. We ultimately decided to **book a day tour from Hoi An**, which proved to be a great choice. This had several advantages, including the convenience of being picked up at our hotel, avoiding the potential delays of long-distance buses, and having a knowledgeable guide for our time in Hue. Our tour was with VM Travel, and our guide was extremely helpful. Visiting the **Imperial City** as the final attraction on the itinerary meant we were able to linger there longer after the rest of the group departed back to Hoi An. Our guide even arranged for us to leave our bags at the restaurant where we had lunch, allowing us to explore the city freely.

***Comment on the night train**: Our night train journey was surprisingly comfortable, definitely exceeding our expectations. We traveled on the S20 train, which is reportedly one of the newer lines, operating only between Da Nang and Hanoi. Although our tickets (booked via 12asia) assigned us to top bunks, we decided to pay an additional 300k VND to the train steward. This secured us the more desirable bottom beds and guaranteed we had the cabin to ourselves. While this may have been unnecessary, the extra comfort and privacy definitely contributed to a relaxing and peaceful night's sleep. Overall, the experience was comparable to a second-class night train in Europe, though I'm not sure I'd risk relying on luck like that again.*

**Day 12 (Ninh Binh):** After arriving by train, we took a Grab taxi to our homestay. I was pleasantly surprised to find a lack of bugs and mosquitos during our time in Ninh Binh in December. For the afternoon, we decided to take the **Trang An boat ride** (250k VND per person). This was absolutely worth it, and we highly recommend choosing route 3, which includes the impressive 1 km-long cave. The landscape was truly beautiful and captivating, making the whole experience unforgettable.

**Day 13 (Ninh Binh):** I wouldn't necessarily recommend spending a day in Ninh Binh exactly as we did. Since we don't have motorcycle licenses, we opted not to rent scooters (and unfortunately, our accommodation didn't offer any smaller \<50cc options). Instead, we took bikes from our homestay. We had initially hoped to explore quite a bit by bike, but the bikes were in rather poor condition, making the cycling more challenging than expected. Despite that, we managed to bike to **Tuyệt Tịnh Cốc**, where we enjoyed a peaceful walk around the lake (costing 50k VND pp), and then continued on to **Hoa Lu**, the ancient capital. However, Hoa Lu was a bit underwhelming for us, perhaps because we didn't have a tour guide or perhaps because I was feeling a bit tired at this point. In any case, we didn't find a lot to see. To end our day, we cycled to Ninh Binh itself and found the pagodas there to be quite lovely. The city had a lively atmosphere, but the darkening sky prompted us to bike back to our accommodation. I'd also add a cautionary note – I nearly got hit by a car at a roundabout, apparently due to a misunderstanding of how they work in Vietnam. 

***Comment on Ninh Binh**: We chose to stay on the outskirts of Ninh Binh, and without a scooter, I felt somewhat isolated. The lack of food delivery options via Grab, combined with no nearby grocery stores, presented us with some limitations. In hindsight, our decision to stay in a secluded area without a motorbike license was not ideal. For those planning a trip to Ninh Binh, I'd highly recommend considering a day tour from Hanoi instead, unless you are comfortable renting a scooter and exploring independently.*

***Comment on Homestay in Ninh Binh:** Our homestay in Ninh Binh was recently opened and absolutely beautiful. However, as we were visiting in December, we experienced what's typical in Vietnamese homes \- a lack of heating. While it wasn't terribly cold, the room wasn't particularly warm either. This was especially noticeable after taking a shower and coming back to a slightly chilly room (around 17° C). If you tend to feel cold easily, it would be a good idea to inquire about heating options in advance.*

**Day 14 (Ninh Binh, → Ha Giang):** In the morning, we visited **Mua Cave**, which is more of a viewpoint than a traditional cave. It was quite nice, though a bit pricey at 100k VND pp. This experience highlighted a trend we noticed in Vietnam and particularly in Ninh Binh: prices often seemed a bit higher for places with “instagram worthy pictures”. It will be interesting to see how this develops in the coming years.

In the afternoon, we decided to visit **Bai Dinh Pagoda**, lured by recommendations from our host and others. While the pagoda itself is indeed the largest we've seen, it's a relatively new site built for sacred buildings. This special trip, which cost us quite a bit more than other activities (taxi each way was 330k VND, and entry was 150k VND per person), ultimately left us feeling a little disappointed. It was a pleasant enough place, but we did not like the way it’s designed. Forcing visitors to take an ""electric bus"" with no option to simply walk, was disheartening. This, coupled with the numerous souvenir stores at the exit, made Bai Dinh feel like the biggest tourist trap we encountered on our trip. On a brighter note, at least you can take an elevator inside the pagoda.

***Sleeper Bus**: In the evening, we began our journey to Ha Giang, having booked a Ha Giang Loop tour through Mike’s travel agency in Ninh Binh, which we later learned was actually based in Tam Coc. A **non-VIP sleeper** bus picked us up, and unfortunately, this night ride turned out to be one of the most unpleasant experiences of our entire trip. While it wasn't necessarily terrible, I cannot stress enough how much of a difference it makes to spend an extra 5-10 € for a VIP sleeper bus. Normal sleeper bus takes twice as long because of its role as a ""taxi"", or that subjects you to a parade of bare feet, spitting, and coughing. The beds on our bus were narrower, but not uncomfortable. However, it was the overall atmosphere and conditions that made it such an unpleasant experience. In hindsight, we should have booked the tour directly with a company from Ha Giang, allowing them to arrange both the tour and the travel. By booking through Mike’s travel agency, we ended up not knowing which tour company or bus operator we were ultimately booked with. For our return trip, we booked new tickets on a VIP sleeper bus, forfeiting the non-VIP tickets that were included in the tour.*

**Day 15 (Ha Giang, Day 1, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016781)):** We arrived at our hostel in Ha Giang around 3-4am and were thankfully provided with a bed for what remained of the night. Breakfast was served at 8am, and our tour was scheduled to depart at 9am. Our tour company was **Hang Hao**. Both of us opted for the **easy rider experience**, and unless you're comfortable and experienced with driving motorbikes, I'd wholeheartedly recommend it; the extra 700k VND per person for the 3-day tour (plus an optional tip) was definitely worth it. We were each permitted to bring a day pack with us (anything smaller than 28 liters will work), which was securely attached to the bike. However, keep in mind that accessing anything from your backpack during the day is quite inconvenient as accessing and then securing the bag takes time, so it's wise to carry a sling bag or keep essential items in your pockets for easier access.

The first day of our Ha Giang loop tour was mostly about **scenic coffee breaks**. We rode for about an hour, then stopped at a café with breathtaking views, and then repeated this pattern for most of the day. In the afternoon, we made a brief stop at a small, traditional wooden palace. For both nights of our tour, we were fortunate enough to have a private room with a bathroom, which was a very welcome comfort.

**It was cold\!** While it started off reasonably mild in the morning, by the afternoon we had ascended to higher elevations further north, where the wind relentlessly cut through all our layers of clothing. Being in Ha Giang on December 23rd, and perhaps experiencing a bout of unseasonably cold weather, it was truly bitterly cold. **I cannot stress enough how important it is not to underestimate the cold here**. I was wearing thin pants, leggings underneath, a long sleeve t-shirt, a puffer jacket, a rain jacket, a buff, and gloves, and even with all of that, I was barely managing to stay warm. The worst part was arriving in a very cold room after the ride. Thankfully, our tour company had arranged for a small heater in our room both nights, but these heaters only warm up a small area effectively. They also emit a lot of light when in use, so it’s definitely wise to pack an eye mask.

***Comment on the food during the tour:** Our lunches and dinners during the Ha Giang tour were fairly similar, consisting of a variety of shared dishes, along with plenty of rice wine for the evenings. We had a generous amount of alcohol at dinner. The meals typically included a mix of eggs, tofu, chicken, pork, rice, pasta, and various vegetable or salad dishes. For breakfast, we usually had pancakes and eggs.*

**Day 16 (Ha Giang, Day 2, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016804)):** Today was particularly exhausting, as we spent more than four hours on the bike. We also had a short additional boat ride during the day. For me, this day was bordering on unpleasant, as I'm not accustomed to sitting on a motorbike for such an extended period. The rest of the day felt quite familiar – we encountered more nice views, made a few coffee stops, and, of course, experienced more of the persistent cold.

**Day 17 (Ha Giang, Day 3, [GPX](https://www.routeyou.com/en/route/view/16016808)):** Today was our shortest day on the tour, and we were grateful, as we were starting to feel a bit unwell. We made a stop at a charming small waterfall, and some of us even took a refreshing dip. The weather was at its best for us today, and I really appreciated the shorter, more comfortable ride. By this point, I was also finally starting to get used to being on the bike. We traveled through more remote areas, providing us with a fascinating glimpse into rural life. After our final day on the loop, we boarded a VIP sleeper bus bound for Hanoi.

***Comment on the Ha Giang Loop:** Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the Ha Giang Loop, and I'm glad we chose the 3-day, 2-night option. Our evenings were well-organized, offering opportunities to socialize for those who wanted to, while also allowing for a quiet night in for those who preferred to rest. Our easy rider drivers were all very nice, even though most of them didn’t speak English (with one exception in our group). The fact that our group was small, consisting of only six people, and that each of us had our own easy rider, made the experience particularly enjoyable. Although we occasionally met up with other groups from the same company at various stops, we shared the table during the meals only in the small group. Finally, please don’t underestimate how cold it can get in the mountains **during December**. While it’s not quite as severe as winter in Europe, I was incredibly grateful to have packed my thin puffer jacket (or a fleece would also have worked well) for those three days.*

***Comment on VIP Sleeper bus**: The VIP sleeper bus was a fantastic experience.The bus was full of tourists, all with the same starting point and destination, and there were no random or unnecessary stops. The food stop we had included a proper clean bathroom (complete with toilet paper\!), which was a welcome change from our previous experiences. It was definitely worth the extra cost, and the journey was much shorter than expected. The only minor inconvenience was that we were taken by shuttle at both the start and the end of the trip, as the sleeper buses don’t typically go into city centers. However, we were able to sleep comfortably, and the beds were great. Best of all, the VIP bus we booked separately left Ha Giang two hours earlier than our original non-VIP bus, and arrived in Hanoi a full four hours sooner, meaning we reached Hanoi at midnight and could get some much-needed rest.*

**Day 18 (Hanoi):** We arrived in Hanoi at midnight, and because we had originally expected to arrive around 4 am, we had booked a really inexpensive hotel in the old town just for a few hours. As it turned out, we ended up spending the night there, but we still approached the hotel with a ""no unpacking"" mindset. Around lunchtime, we moved to our more comfortable hotel for the next couple of days. In the afternoon, we joined an **old town tour** with **Hanoikids**, a student-run organization. Overall, I think we were feeling quite tired by this point in our trip, so we took a more relaxed approach to exploring Hanoi.

**Day 19 (Hanoi):** Today, we visited the **Hỏa Lò Prison** and the **Temple of Literature**. While we definitely enjoyed the audio guide in the prison, we also reached for other informational sources (e.g. Wikipedia) during our visit. The audio guide for the Temple was probably not worth it. Both guides cost 100k VND per person. After those visits, we took a walk through the city before heading back to our hotel. On weekend nights, the old town closes some streets to traffic and hosts night markets. This transformation made the town much more enjoyable, as it was finally pedestrian-friendly. We bought some souvenirs and enjoyed strolling through the lively streets.

**Day 20 (Ha Long Bay)**: We opted for a **one-day tour to Halong Bay**, and I have to say, it felt as if about 70% of our time was spent traveling. The queue for the cave during the tour was exceptionally long, and the area was crowded with ships. While the bay itself is undeniably beautiful, and we were lucky enough to witness a truly breathtaking sunset there, be prepared to spend most of your day in transit. We decided against a two-day tour primarily because of our susceptibility to sea sickness. Additionally, many of the two-day tours did not seem to offer more activities at the end, instead simply departing Hanoi later in the day and returning the next day. Poor planning by our tour company meant that, due to the early sunset, we almost didn't make it to the top of Ti Top Island, as access isn't allowed after dark.

**Day 21 (Hanoi):**  We visited the **Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and Museum**. Fortunately, the queue for the mausoleum was only about 20 minutes long on a Sunday morning. The museum, however, wasn't particularly interesting to me, as it felt more like an art gallery than a historical exhibit. Also, there's a real lack of clarity about opening hours, as it seems the mausoleum is only open in the morning. Both the mausoleum and museum are closed on Fridays and Mondays, and they also have a lunch break, which makes planning a visit quite challenging. For the mausoleum, we had to check our bags and larger electronics (including cameras, but not phones). In the afternoon, we went to the **Vietnam Museum of Ethnology**, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I especially appreciated the outside area, which showcases various architectural styles from different ethnic groups. As a final activity, we attended a **water puppet show at the Lotus Theater**, which was a really fun and unique experience.

**Day 22 (Hanoi):** We’ve reserved our final day for some last-minute shopping. We bought some clothes (it's worth noting that Uniqlo is cheaper here, but the sizes run very small and short\!), mostly souvenirs, and some roasted coffee. In the evening, we went to the famous **train street** and were fortunate enough to see two trains pass by within a span of just 20 minutes. Afterwards, we headed to the airport. Unfortunately, our final experience in Vietnam included our only scam. The taxi driver first requested 50k in cash for ""airport fees,"" then requested to use our phone. He then proceeded to give himself a 50k tip via the phone’s payment app, leaving a 5-star review, and returned the phone along with the ""airport fees"" in cash. In hindsight, I think the best approach would have been to simply get out of the taxi, but it’s difficult when your luggage is already inside the car.

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / OUR EXPERIENCE**  
**—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------—-----------------**

**Cost Breakdown for 22-Day Trip (for Two People)**

* **During Vacation Expenses:** : 2477€  
  * accommodation, transportation, food, day tours, tips, souvenirs, etc.  
* **Flights:** 1737€  
  * from Europe, partially during Christmas time  
* **Clothes Bought During the Travel:** 200€  
  * mostly custom-made in Hoi An

**Total Cost Per Person: 2207€**

Our travel style for this trip could be described as ""Comfortable travel / Midscale."" We opted for a number of choices that contributed to higher expenses, including frequently dining at restaurants that offered Western food, always staying in hotels, relying heavily on taxis, and taking domestic flights instead of night buses. We also chose to take many organized tours rather than self-organizing our travels. With a few adjustments, I can definitely imagine still enjoying a comfortable trip while keeping our ""during vacation"" expenses around 1700€.

**SIM:** For our trip, we purchased a 30-day, 5GB/day data plan from Gigago for 19.90 USD. We had initially attempted to buy a SIM card online from tourist.viettel.vn, but unfortunately, we were unsuccessful. We were also specifically looking for an eSIM, which many physical vendors do not offer. Generally, in Vietnam, the same data plan should be readily available for around 300k VND, or even less directly from Viettel. However, we opted for Gigago to avoid any potential issues, such as the hassle of passport verification, not getting an eSIM, or the possibility of the SIM card not working due to scams.

**Food:** We wouldn't consider ourselves foodies, and our meals during this trip included a mix of both Vietnamese and Western options. However, it's important to note that the taste of Western meals may not always be exactly as you'd expect them. Also, Western food is generally three to five times more expensive than Vietnamese food. We were also careful to pay attention to reviews and only ate at establishments that had access to a sink, at a minimum. This approach may have been slightly more expensive.

**Weather**: Our stay in Nha Trang was unfortunately not as enjoyable as we had hoped, mostly because of the persistent rain. In contrast, although we were in Hoi An during its rainy season, the weather did not bother us as much. It's worth keeping in mind that we were told that floods are a fairly common occurrence in Hoi An during the rainy season, but they tend to be quick and usually recede within one or two days.

**Clothing**: For this trip, my packing list included 7 t-shirts \+ 1 long-sleeve, 1 pair of shorts, 1 dress, 1 skirt (which I didn't end up using), 2 pairs of long pants, 7 pairs of underwear, 1 light sun shirt hoodie (which was really thin), a thin Decathlon down jacket, and a rain jacket. We did laundry four times during the trip, with each service costing between 40-105k VND for two people. For my next trip, I would definitely pack 2-3 more t-shirts and pairs of underwear. Otherwise, my packing list worked well, allowing me to cope with the hot weather while still being appropriately dressed for the colder conditions in the mountains.

**Shoes**: For this trip, I only brought my Teva Universal sandals and Decathlon Kiprun TR2 trail running shoes, and they proved to be perfectly adequate. I didn't feel the need for any other shoes at all.

**Transport**: See in the text for more information

* Good:   
  * Bamboo airways,   
  * Vietnam Airlines,   
  * VIP Sleeper Bus (Quang Giang),   
  * 4 bed train compartment  
* Bad:   
  * normal (non-VIP) sleeper bus

**Accommodation**: We primarily booked hotels in the €22.5 \- €49 per night range, which generally provided us with some solid mid-range options. The rooms always looked true to the photos, however, the level of cleanliness was not quite up to what we would consider ""western standards"". We did encounter some minor, yet slightly bothersome issues, such as stained sheets, mold on the window, ants in the room, and even a gecko in one of our rooms (each issue was in a different hotel).

**Vaccinations**: It's worth noting that no vaccinations were mandatory for us (which may depend on your country of origin). However, we decided to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A (and we were already vaccinated against Hepatitis B), rabies, and typhoid fever.

**Paying by card**: Almost every establishment will charge a fee of 3-4% for payments made with a foreign credit card. We primarily exchanged cash (Euros) in Vietnam, and we were able to use TP Bank ATMs without incurring any extra fees when using our Revolut & Wise cards. Keep some cash with you for markets and smaller shops.

Are vietnamese people secretly rich? So for some context, my Vietnam friend who came to sg recently. She told me she came to Singapore to work because her family is poor and she is paid more here in SG.

She told me she has a dream to buy a house for the family and send her siblings to school which is the reason why she came to work here.

  
But despite saying she has financial difficulties, she lives a very lavish lifestyle currently. She loves to go fine dining , drinking, owns branded items and she is very high maintenance. And she said she wants to own a restaurant business, buy a rolex, own a sportscar etc. Her social media is filled with very luxurious lifestyle that just does not align with what she said about her family's financial situation to be poor.

Because if my family is poor, I would not spend my hard earn money I made on a lavish lifestyle right? But instead build my family finances right? So it just kept me wondering are they just secretly rich?

On top of that, she told me that many of her friends in their early 20s, that she met in hanoi are already owning a fine dining restaurant and other business trades as well.

Because of her very lavish lifestyle, her spendings are always very high but it just does not make sense that the family is poor but she lives a lavish lifestyle. or are they just secretly rich?

I recently went through a rough break up and decided to pay an escort a visit in my home country, cos you know that's the most sensible thing a guy would do when he's heartbroken, amirite? 

So I met this nice Vietnamese lady which claims she's from HCM. She was very kind to me which was weird cos sex workers in that particular spot are known to be a bit aloof towards their customers and just wanna get the job done.

And thus, just like any genius would do, I visited her a couple more times after that. Even took her out on dates which I had to pay a huge sum of money to her agent cos she was still around the clock.

Long story short, she invited me to HCM which I accepted cos Goddammit I just wanted to be loved guys, please don't judge me. 🥺

She offered to stay at her place which she says her friend lets her stay for free (I did some digging later on and it was actually an Airbnb - more on that in just a while).

We talked about the nature of our relationship where we hinted we might have feelings for each other and she said she's only doing escorting to pay off her debt, so we can't be officially together for the time being. However, this is where it gets interesting fellas. Each time we meet, her debt amount differs. At first it was 2m (my country's currency) cos she got cheated by her business partner, then during another date she said it was 500k which she owes her ex gangster bf. And the last one she claimed she had around 40k debt with 2 banks and that was what needed to be paid immediately.

She showed me the warnings and emails from the banks, I checked and looked legit I thought. So like any gentleman who craves for love would do, I offered to help since the deadline was closing in. She refused at first and said she could ask her best friend's help. Then after a while she looked even more troubled cos her friend couldn't lend her the money. And you guys know where this is going. Yes, I lent her the money. Without thinking. Right away. I lent people money before, mostly close friends, but that was the first time I did it with a person I only knew for a couple of months.

But hear me out guys, I had a solid reason. She introduced her daughter to me (her biological dad went out to buy milk and never came back, bro fr I'm not even kidding you - poor girl), and who I found to be the most adorable little girl in the world. I am by nature a kid-lover (ok that sounds criminally wrong, FBI pls don't knock on my door) - I adore children because they're innocent and cute and I have a lot of nephews and nieces back home. So I thought, she can't be using this little girl to scam money out of me. My thought process went back and forth trying to decide between whether this is legit or a scam and decided on the former.

I had a nice time in HCM and went home after around 5 days. Before I left, we even had a group hug with her daughter and cried (mostly me lol).

A few weeks later, she informed me that she's coming back to work in my home country. Which I don't really mind tbh cos it's not like we're in any kind of relationship. But things started to get weirder when everytime I asked her for clarifications on the things she told me, she either didn't reply cos she said she was busy or she avoided answering saying I brought her bad energy and that I talk too much.

I had a gut feeling when multiple red flags were raised at the beginning cos I wasn't thinking rationally and only let my heart doing the thinking. But this time I'm absolutely sure it's a love scam.

When I pushed her for an answer again a few days ago, she finally blocked me on everything - Zalo, WhatsApp, IG. 

So yea, I guess I got scammed. 100% my fault, not gonna blame this on others and gotta be accountable for the decisions I made.

Here's the special Tet you shouldn't sleep on","Travel/Du lịch",False,0,False,42,"While 'Tet' (Lunar New Year) begins on January 29, 2025, the H'Mong people will celebrate their traditional Tet starting on December 30, 2024 (the 30th day of the 11th lunar month), lasting for 20 days thereafter.The H'Mong people have their own Tet, calculated differently from the Chinese or Vietnamese calendar. For the H'Mong, Tet always falls in the 12th month of the lunar calendar, and every 30 days is counted as Tet. It is a time for resting, celebrating, and hosting friends and family. Often, large pigs and fat chickens are slaughtered for the occasion. Around the 26th day, villages begin preparations by slaughtering pigs and inviting each other over. On the morning of the 30th, a chicken is sacrificed to offer to the spirits, ancestors, and the deceased.During the first three days of Tet, incense is lit every morning to invite the spirits and ancestors to join in the celebration. On the third day, paper is burned as an offering to send the spirits, ancestors, and deceased back to the heavens. From the 10th to the 15th day of the lunar month, a full moon offering is made, marking the end of Tet.Afterward, people gather to enjoy spring, attend festivals, and celebrate. Spring is also an opportunity for young men and women to meet, connect, and find their soulmates. This makes spring the most beautiful season, full of hope and meaning.
How can I engage in this activity?
To engage in the H'Mong traditional Tet celebration, visit Northern Vietnam, particularly Ha Giang, Lao Cai (Sa Pa), or Dien Bien, where the H'Mong community resides. On the first morning of Tet, families wake early to fetch fresh water, a ritual believed to bring good fortune to those who arrive first. Participate in traditional rituals like lighting incense, preparing offerings, and enjoying festive meals. Unique customs include eating only meat during Tet to restore health, avoiding pouring broth over rice, and refraining from blowing on the fire to symbolize protection from storms.The fourth day of Tet marks the start of lively gatherings with traditional music, dancing, games, and social events. 
Remember that with dressing appropriately, respecting customs, and seeking permission for photos, you can experience the warmth, vibrancy, and cultural richness of H'Mong Tet in a respectful and meaningful way.",False,False,0.98,"","2025-01-04 04:19:51","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Naturally, she raised us to be very Viet or as close to as how her ông ngoại - bà ngoại (my ông cố bà cố) raised her, so very old school. I've longed to be with people like me. Where I'm from, our community is very little but it's the closest thing to home away from home. 

I'm posting today to say hi to my fellow Viet because I cannot wait to say hi to you in person. I will be all over Vietnam, so wherever you are from, please recommend me places to visit. Alcohol with my friends is a plus lol 

Edit: I was born and raised in the U.S. I often refer to the States as home away from home because even though I utilize English more frequently and to a higher degree, there are Viet expressions that cannot be found in languages rooted in Latin.

Maybe someone has some useful advice.

I'm going to Vietnam in March and I'm not a classic tourist but a kind of traveler, a researcher of life who collects experiences and impressions for writing.

So, I'm not too interested in the crowds in tourist centers but in the ordinary life of local people and I would like to go a little into the rainforest in the north, to smaller islands, etc.

How can I find someone who speaks English to go with me?

Of course I pay the expenses and the fee.

How much could it cost me?

It seems stupid to me to ask the receptionist at the hotel or contact a travel agency because I don't need a boring professional guide... I prefer an ordinary person who has time and wants to earn money.

I am looking at booking a flight with Vietnam   Airlines from Busan to Bangkok. There’s a 2:50 hr layover at the Noi Bai airport. I will have a checked bag so I was unsure if I would need to recheck it in and then go through customs again. I emailed them and they said this:

“Normally, as VNA policy, if:
- Your flights are all international flights and
- All flights were issued in the same ticket or same airlines (VNA)
- Your connection time is not over 24 hours and not overnight.

Passenger are given 1 boarding pass for the first segment and change the boarding pass for the next flight at the transfer counter of the airport. Luggages will be checked through to last destination.
Please double check with ground staff at the airport when you do checkin, because in case the system at the departure airport and connecting airport have straight procedure, passenger will be issued 2 boarding passes.”

So this means I wouldn’t have to check it in again right? And I can just go to the gate for the next flight? Also I have a United States Passport, would I need a visa or transit visa?

What’s more, it tends to be only those from certain cultures or countries. Specifically, over the last three years traveling principally in SEA, Chinese, Indians, and Russians seem to be the most loudmouthed, obnoxious people on the planet.

Let me get this out of the way, I’m not trying to dump on these cultures, and I’ve seen people from many countries act like morons. As a Canadian, I’ve seen my own countrymen act like complete dicks in several countries. However, these tend to be outliers and, overall, I think Westerners have a fairly well-deserved reputation for being considerate or at least friendly when in someone else’s country.

As for the Chinese, Indians, and Russians, many people will say that most are fantastic, and the rude ones are also outliers. However, my experience says otherwise. Although I’ve seen rude Koreans and Japanese on occasion, if a large group of Asians is being particularly loud and obnoxious, they are generally from China. I’ve also had several bad interactions with many Indians, the latest being one that literally pushed me out of the way so he could yell at the concierge I was speaking to. I lost it of course and got in his face, which had him turn tail rather quickly. Finally, my interactions with Russians have been more limited, but several times now in airports in Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia, I’ve had Russians, individually and as families, literally walk to the front of the line at check in and customs. Even when addressed by fellow travelers and staff they refuse to move to the back. Where do they get the entitlement?

So, my question is this, “if” in fact Chinese, Indians, and Russians tend to be ruder and more obnoxious than other cultures, at least when in SEA, why? Is it a cultural thing?

* Allows you to get a permanent VN phone number without further documentation
* Allows you to open a bank account without further documentation
* Allows you to get a tax ID

Steps for getting a CCCD after you get a VN passport from aboard:

1. Prove your VN citizenship 
2. Prove that you have a permanent residence in VN (thường trú)
3. Get a personal identification number (số định danh cá nhân) 
4. Apply for a CCCD, then schedule to get your biometrics taken
5. Pick up your CCCD on your automatically scheduled date

Before going through the steps, however, you must locate your closest UBND (Ủy ban Nhân dân) or People's Committee office. Search for UBND on google maps closest to your chosen address of permanent residence. This is because the bureaucracy level required to manage your paperwork is based on this address. Depending on what type of residence this address is (house, apartment, etc.), you may have to prove either ownership, rental agreement, or relationship to the owner of the residence.

Step 1: proving your VN citizenship involves having your original birth certificate and a VN passport. If your VN passport is made aboard, it must have immigration entry stamp(s). Have a photocopy of each (several first pages of the VN passport including the page with entry stamps).

Step 2: like mentioned above, you prove that you have a permanent residence in VN and intend to live there. There is a requirement that you have stayed at this residence for 90 days, but this requirement is often not enforceable and therefore often waived. Your mileage may vary on which documentation you need to prove your residence. If you own or rent a place (long term), then you would just bring that paperwork. If you are staying with family, then you need a family book with your name or parents' names on it. You may need to prove your relationship to the owners via birth or death certificates. You must be present to sign the paper that you intend to live at that residence (part time allowed).

Step 3: once you have proven to the above to the UBND office, then they will work to provide you with a life-long personal identification number (số định danh cá nhân). This number is given automatically to children born in VN but not to citizens who have left a long time ago or born abroad (without notification). This number will be printed on your CCCD and required for any permanent phone number or permanent bank account.

Step 4: you can apply for your CCCD card at the same office (or different office if you choose, but it will take longer since they have to retrieve your files from the originating office). They will give you a date/time for your appointment to have your biometrics (fingerprints and iris scan) taken, along with your blurry picture. You must be present, obviously, and also pay the fee and sign the paperwork.

Step 5: you are automatically scheduled to pick up the CCCD. It may arrive sooner than that date. Someone may be able to pick it up on your behalf.

Processing and expedited fees may be applicable based your residence, additional documentations, and processing office.

However, I regretted staying in the Tam Coc area. It's too touristy for me. Feel the entire Tam Coc is built for white tourists. The restaurants here cater to white tourists, and the food here is expensive compared to Hanoi. I don’t see Vietnamese people eating there. 

I’m a cheap backpacker. I know some people want to make fun of budget travelers. Today, I had a set of Com Binh Dan (the pre-cooked meal with rice) for dinner in the Tam Coc area of Ninh Binh. There is no marked price. The owner told me the price is 50K for four food in a tray.  I chose chicken meat and three vegetables. I sat down and ate the meal but wasn’t sure if the price was correct. In Hanoi, I had the food in a tray, and the cost of two meats and two veggies was between 30 and 40ks. Why is the price in northern Vietnam more than in the capital? I checked with the owner; she told me that everyone, including the locals, pays the same amount, 50k. I insisted on only paying after seeing a local pay the same amounts. The owner agreed. I waited there after my meal and saw a local Vietnamese man had the same tray, and he paid 50k. Then, I made a payment and left. 

I’m confused about why Com Binh Dan is cheaper in Hanoi, the capital(the portion was smaller, though).  I asked the owner, and she said she could have given me less food to match the price in Hanoi had I told her. (Tonight, they gave me a little more food). 

However, I’m still wondering if I was cheated, and the local man was “paying” in front of me for a show, and he will get the change back when I leave.  

I know it’s little money here and there—it wasn’t much. But I just want to ask how much the locals pay for a Com Binh Dan in the city area. How much do you locals pay for one tray of food, one meat, three vegetables, and rice?? 

I love Vietnamese food, but I constantly have to watch out for street vendors who do not have a marked price. ",False,False,0.14,"","2025-01-02 15:40:23","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

DAY 2: Trip to Cat Ba from Hanoi (what do you recommend? any companies? tours?

DAY 7: Transfer to Da Nang, Hoi An - sightseeing

Quick background: was born in VN, left as a baby, grew up in France and lived all over the world for 30 years before returning 4 years ago. Due to my high qualifications and track record I got a leadership position at an MNC in Saigon with salary north of 160 million VND net per month. Life has been good, I travelled, I ate my heart out, explored my identity. Hitting all KPIs at the company and creating impact.

But what's next?

My own intellectual and professional development has totally stalled as there are very few people around me with similar qualifications. To get higher in the ranks (CEO) is impossible without going into politics, or marry a COCC.. . Meanwhile, my skills are not necessarily applicable to companies abroad anymore as I've been working in the local context for so long. Some people recommend me to build a business, but I know that without political backing, no company can really reach a substantial valuation of more than 50 million USD (I am not interested in opening another restaurant).

Has anyone of you been in a similar situation? What made you decide to stay vs leave? What changes did you make to still grow professionally and intellectually in Vietnam?

Any thoughts welcome! Thanks!

PS: I know I live a very privileged life in Vietnam (I also worked my ass off for it). But I hope you can empathize that my problems are also valid. I am a very growth-oriented person and will get depressed without it.

The flight we were coming in on was an hour late which now made our transfer time in Ho Chi Minh only one hour instead of two. 

When we arrived at the ticket counter to re-check our luggage, the ticket agent told us that the lines for immigration and security were longer than an hour and we would miss our flight if we waited in line. She asked us if we wanted to purchase an “expedited pass” for $25/person to expedite these lines. Confused and frustrated that we were going to have to pay $50 in order to make our flight when our original flight into Ho Chi Minh was delayed, we agreed to pay. However, when my partner took out their credit card to pay for the expedited pass, the expedited pass magically wasn’t available anymore, and we were sent to stand in the immigration line for 45 minutes. The line for security was another 40 minutes long. 

LSS: if you are asked by Cambodian Angkor Air ticket agents in Ho Chi Minh airport to pay for an “expedited pass” to go through immigration and security, it’s a scam/bribe. They want your cash.

One interesting thing I noticed: at one bar, there’s a guy sitting right next to the balloon sellers, looking like he’s passed out.

An issue I had however (and a bad experience from my perspective) are the somehow “scammy” schemes that the people/workers/laborers do at the Coconut boat thing (sorry im not rlly good at names and places). The agent which arranges you for a ticket to get the boats and the ‘tour’ will give you an upfront price but will not disclose you of the other activities that will be done within the said tour.

Then there will be some form of entertainment stuff that will be done within the tour (dont wanna spoil it for all). No issue with that whatsoever but the insisted tipping is what icks me. However the biggest issue is not the kinda forceful tipping, it's the 70k VND picture. If you are a tourist it feels like it is required within the tour. I hated that, I was on the spot required to pull out 70k VND out of my pocket and I dont even like taking pictures and printing pictures that way. Basically the tour gets to a point where there are ppl with cameras (yes, real cameras. on a mangrove setting) and a pc set up. They take pictures of you multiple times, like you are in a photoshoot. Then they make you choose which and how many to print, comes out to be 70k VND each print.

Mind you that I am just a student and I dont have my own money yet so the cash my Mom gave me as my allowance in Vietnam does not run deep pockets. Also, I dont like being forced to do things, especially paying, as a tourist. It kinda freaks me out. There were little bits of scams here and there in Vietnam but i understand that no country is perfect that way. Just this one thing was the issue for me.

I've never travelled alone before, but I still want to visit Vietnam. It will be kind of like backpacking, or maybe more like a ""relax and experience the country and culture"" kind of trip. The reason for my interest to travel to Vietnam is because my ex and her family is vietnamese and I've always wanted to experience their home country.

I was wondering if I could get some help from this community. Any places/cities I should visit, any attractions that is worth looking up, and any ideas on where I can stay while I'm there? I'm prepared to check out any places, as I don't want to be picky and use most of my money on that.

I was also planning on maybe do some sort of charity work, but all the places I've looked at online so far requires a bit of money to apply for the charity work. If anyone got any ideas for that as well would be great. It could be just working at home for someone or anything else, as long as I get to do something meaningful to someone.

My mother and I will be visiting Vietnam from January 14 to January 22. I've taken the lead on planning our itinerary and have done quite a bit of research on activities and sights to see. I’ve gathered suggestions from various sources and mapped everything out on Google Map to find out which places are close together. While I don’t plan to force ourselves to visit everything—especially if my mom gets tired—it’s nice to have a plan in place. That said, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed and worry that I might have overlooked something.

I feel like I’ve packed a lot into our time in Hanoi while keeping the last two days more relaxed. If you have any recommendations for places to add or remove, I’d love your input! Also, does anyone know how much tours in Ninh Binh typically cost? The only tours I found on Klook start from Hanoi, but I've already booked our accommodations in Ninh Binh.

I was sitting at the park area across the HCMC People's Committee when I was approached by a shoe cleaner guy wanting to clean my shoe.  I've read about this scam so I'm already aware.  I politely said no, he was persistent, but I managed to get away.  I crossed the street to move to the other side.  A few minutes later, it's him again.  He was much more aggressive this time wanting to clean my shoe.  He actually grabbed it and won't let go.  When I finally pulled off of him, I just walked towards where there are more people around.  He stopped pursuing because I had my phone out and he thought I was recording him.

The next day, I was walking near Takashimaya when I saw some Japanese guy getting pursued by a shoe cleaner guy and gave in.

They usually target solo male travellers, but not exclusively and usually but not exclusively hang around park areas.  You can easily spot them as they carry a small box with shoe cleaning stuff.  You see one of them, walk the other way.  Don't be polite.

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

Hi everyone! 

My partner and I are planning our honeymoon and we’re looking for recommendations for an 8-night trip focused on food, relaxation, and cultural experiences, with some upper-scale accommodations. We’re currently considering Hanoi and Hoi An as our main destinations. Both places seem like they offer a great mix of food culture and history, plus we’re looking for some luxury stays to unwind.

A few things to note:

We’re not too concerned about visiting beaches
We want to experience a mix of delicious local food, cultural sights, and some time to relax at a nice resort or boutique hotel. 


Questions:

Do you think Hanoi and Hoi An are enough to fill 8 nights, or would it be worth adding a third city (maybe Hue or Ho Chi Minh City)?
Any must-try dishes or experiences we should add to our itinerary?
Any recommendations for luxury stays in either of these cities?

But before we were able to get in the car, the driver was saying that we only booked a 4 seater car even though we literally checked it multiple times that we were booking a 7 seater car.

When we asked the security if we needed to cancel the booking and book a new one, the security said yes but then the driver got mad that we cancelled the booking. My family was already starting to doubt me and my cousin on what we had booked but we already told them multiple times that we booked a 7 seater because there was a big gap on the price with the 4 seater.

I have just realised we will be travelling in Vietnam during Tet. We are fulltime slow travellers with two young kids, we are not busy people, and are not there to do anything overly touristy, so I'd love to know what to expect during our time (mostly to prepare our children, and food etc) and how we can remain respectful but enjoy our time.

We will be flying into Da Nang on the 22nd of January. We will be staying in Hoi An walking distance to An Bang beach from the 22nd Jan - 10th Feb. 10th of Feb we will be flying to Hanoi, then departing Vietnam on the 16th. 

What does Hoi An look like on these dates? What date do most restaurants and stores officially close and re-open (as a rough guide, so we can ensure we have groceries etc). And does anyone foresee any issues getting to the airport in De Nang to fly to Hanoi on the 10th Feb? Is there anything we should be aware of culturally - for example can we still spend days at the beach during Tet?

Getting a police report was a major challenge. The police here can be… difficult to deal with. I first went to the station near Nguyen Hue in Ho Chi Minh City, and they told me they don’t handle lost passport reports and suggested I go somewhere else. The lady from my hotel who accompanied me implied that they wanted me to claim I lost it in a different area so they wouldn’t have to deal with it.

In the end, I had to follow their advice because every other station I went to kept passing me along to someone else. After about eight hours of going in circles, I finally managed to get a police report from the Bui Vien police station. Ironically, I didn’t even lose my passport in their area—I had to make up a story just to get them to process it.

Now that I finally have the police report, I’m being given the runaround by immigration. Today, they told me they couldn’t find my registration in their system and that I need to go to a police station to register myself. However, my hotel insists they already registered me on the immigration website. I don’t know if immigration is being deliberately difficult, but based on my experience with the police, it wouldn’t surprise me.

The whole process is incredibly frustrating. Vietnam has a system where you need an exit visa just to leave the country. Right now, they’re refusing to issue me one and seem to keep finding reasons to delay. This means I’m effectively stuck here. Since immigration is likely closed tomorrow for New Year’s Day, I can’t even go back until the 2nd.

Has anyone faced this issue here or had to deal with the cops and immigration. I've been to immigration four times now and it's always a different excuse. Yes I have contacted my consulate but I doubt they can do much except offer advice. 

TL;DR : Don't lose your passport here or your life will be made hell by Vietnamese bureaucracy. 

EDIT: Yes I have an emergency travel document and a letter to Vietnamese immigration from the British government. Despite this, Vietnamese immigration are still being difficult. Also I lost my passport at the airport somewhere but it wasn't found there. The police there wouldn't issue me a police report as they said I probably lost it somewhere else.

I'm sharing my family's experience as guidance to other Westerners considering travel there -- and as a thank you to the wonderful people who made our trip so special.


For context, we are two parents and two college/university children who live in a big US city. We have taken several overseas vacations, but never as far as East Asia. 

We spent 4 nights in Ho Chi Minh City, 3 nights in Ninh Binh (Tam Coc), and 2 nights in Hanoi. We avoided Danang and the surrounding area because it is the rainy season there (we'll get there next time!). 


General thoughts: 
* Vietnam is ridiculously inexpensive. Luxury hotels for $50 a night with gorgeous buffet breakfasts included, amazing meals for $4, 15-minute rideshares for $2, etc. It is literally cheaper to vacation for 10 days in Vietnam INCLUDING AIRFARE than it is to vacation in most big American cities -- no exaggeration.
* The people are awesome. Wandering through neighborhoods or chilling in cafes, we found locals and tourists alike to be friendly. 
* The air quality was shockingly bad. There's a thick haze everywhere. I was breathing extra heavily when exercising. I thought it would be better in Tam Coc outside the major metropolitan areas, but nope -- still bad.
* The food was unfreakingbelieveable. We're relatively adventurous eaters, and we were blown away by the incredible flavors.
* Vietnamese coffee is amazing, but y'all need to step up your craft beer game (sorry).
* HCMC and Hanoi are intense! The traffic, the constant pedestrian traffic, the lack of sidewalk space -- it's all exhilarating and exhausting, even for people from a big American city. Fortunately, y'all have great parks for decompressing from the bustle. 
* People, especially seniors, are in amazing shape -- at least compared to Westerners.
* The War Remnants Museum is a gut-punch but filled with important, well-organized, and tactfully presented content. It's a must-see, especially for Americans.
* The Independence Palace, on the other hand, was kinda boring.
* Ninh Binh/Tam Coc was breathtaking. The Mua Cave hike, the Trang An paddle boat ride, the pagodas --  so special.
* By happenstance, we were at Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi during the National Defense Day celebration. Very cool to witness, especially after visiting the War Remnants Museum a few days earlier.


Tips for Westerners planning a Vietnam vacation:
* Download the Grab app. It's awesome and easy, and we avoided scammy taxi drivers.
* Eat where the locals eat. We found great spots simply by politely asking hotel staff, ""Where do YOU eat?"" 
* Find hotels outside the most touristy areas (we stayed in the Phu Nhuan district in HCMC). This is good advice for any vacation destination -- if you stay where the tourists stay, you'll get a tourist experience, complete with overpriced tourist-focused food, souvenir shops, etc. Instead, stay off the beaten path and take a $2-$3 Grab ride to the main attractions when you want to see them.


TL;DR: Amazing, intense experience wonderful people, culture, and food. We loved visiting your country and look forward to exploring more of it another time.

As I'm about to hit 30, I feel like I'm at my peak, but I'm worried this will soon decline. Since today is the end of 2024, I woke up early because I couldn't sleep, and these thoughts have been on my mind.

Edit: The reasons that keep me thinking is that I will be 30 soon, and would like to have a wife, kids. For a more compatible partner, it takes time to find and know the person. And the later it takes the more disadvantages in dating world I have, since younger women see me too old, and older woman may already have kids and stuff.",False,False,0.7,"","2024-12-31 05:38:29","2024-12-31 09:24:05"

Both victims had registered for long-term temporary residence at the tourist villa starting from July 4, 2024.

Upon receiving the report, Quảng Nam Provincial Police directed relevant units and local authorities to conduct a scene investigation and external autopsies. Initial findings showed no signs of scratches or external force on the bodies.

Take this with a grain of salt, maybe I'm just too used to visiting countries where they don't try to scam or cheat you all the time 😂

Edit:

Forgot to add the airport experience. All airports are terrible, but man I've never had to wait in line for two hours to go through immigration. Also they managed to mess up my visa date, cutting it short by 1 day (no, I didn't make the error, I have a screenshot of my e-visa application and have selected the correct dates for start/end). This error ended up on me, and I had to pay another $65 to make a new visa, luckly we were going to Malaysia this trip ao it wasn't a problem, otherwise I would have had to do one of those border bus runs 😬🎅

Like I mentioned, don't be too discouraged by my opinions, you might have a much better experience. We did loce it there overall, just not enough to plan our next Vietnam visit.

I'll be there for about 2 months with my family. We've got plans for the first couple of weeks, and a rough plan from early Feb, but we've got a gap that we need to fill, which coincides with Tet. I've not experienced Tet before, so I'm really not sure what to do. 



The gap is from 25/01 - 04/02, and the gap will start and end in HCM. We're going to Mui Ne prior to this gap (sounds like it's changed a lot in 15 years, but I have my reasons for returning), and we're not looking to fly or have 6 hour+ bus journeys in this gap. Our current plan is to spend a few days in the Mekong Delta, and a few days in Vung Tao. What I'm not sure of is how much Tet will affect us (restaurants closed, tour operators shut, traffic jams etc.), and how we should arrange this portion to minimise the impact. 

At this stage I'm thinking that we head to the Mekong on the 25th, do a few day tours etc., then return to HCM on the 28th or 29th (if the 28th then we can enjoy the fireworks/festivities in HCM), before heading to Vung Tau on 29th or 30th, where we'll stay until the 2nd or 3rd before returning to HCM.



Can anyone give me some advice on how Tet will affect me? I assume that the bulk of the closures (restaurants, tours etc.) will be 29th and after, which is why'd we do the Delta first, because we're more likely to want to do tours there. I assume (from what I've read) that Vung Tau will be mostly open, but busy. And I assume that heading from Mekong --> HCM on 28th or 29th will be against traffic, and that from HCM --> Vung Tau on 29th or 30th won't be as busy as 27th & 28th.

but my parents think otherwise. while they don't stop me from moving back, but they say i'm stupid for doing so. mainly for 2 reasons, i would have to take a large pay cut, i would have lesser money for savings and my quality of life worsens with the dusty environment and lack of quality healthcare. 

while i do agree with their point, i don't wanna make a ton of money overseas, only to get to see my parents like thrice a year, then regret not seeing them more often when they grow old and die. this prob has something to do with the PTSD i got when my grandma passed away when i was still on probation in my first job and i didn't dare to take days off to fly back to attend her funeral cuz i worried they'd fire me.

I'm a big foodie, but obviously my parents are worried about food poisoning since they are older and they have no trust in VN hygiene. What's the consensus on eating fresh seafood at Vung Tau?

Any recs for sightseeing? Unfortunately we considered other beach towns like nha trang, but convenience is important because they are old and not as mobile to do too much traveling, so taking a car to VT from Hcmc seems easier for them to handle. 

FYI, starting out in D1, then VT, then back for a few nights in D3 to rest before flying back. Would love any must eat places in D1 or D3 too, with hygiene top of mind. It would totally reinforce our parents negative perception of VN if they got food poisoning 😩

The departure time was approaching quickly, but I hadn't heard from the tour agency (Amazing Nature Travel) until noon today. A little concerned, I messaged their contact number but got no response.

A quick Google search revealed some red flags about the agency, so I contacted Trip.com's customer support. The helpful rep there managed to get in touch with the agency, but all they received was confirmation that my booking was secure. Still concerned, I bombarded all contact number and email I could possibly find, the agency finally responded my email by asking me to cancel my booking (of course, cancellation wasn't an option at that point!). I immediately contacted Trip's support for full refund, will update soon.

Since time was running out, I scrambled to find another transport option. Luxcotravels.com seemed promising, and a sales rep initially confirmed a limousine is still available for tomorrow. However, things took another turn when they told me about a car accident and switched my booking to a cabin bus. Despite the cabin bus presumably being cheaper, they insisted on charging the same price. 

Additionally, I initially booked my trip to Sapa through my hotel in Hanoi, I opted for a private cabin VIP bus. However, my journey began unexpectedly. Instead of the expected VIP bus, I was picked up at 6 AM in a smaller vehicle. I understand this was easier for smaller vehicles to collect passengers and then bring them to a central point for boarding the actual cabin bus. Unfortunately in my case, I ended up being transferred between three different small buses before finally reaching the correct bus stop around 8 AM. That's why I chose limousine this time to go back to Hanoi. 

At this point, I'm just too exhausted and just hoping to get back to Hanoi, so whatever bus that can pick me up early tomorrow. I think I have enough of Sapa.

Lesson Learned: Sapa is definitely worth visiting, but the transportation booking is hell. Could be because it is peak season(?) 
So yea, always research the agencies beforehand and consider double-checking communication channels before you pay.

Update: So I made it in time to Hanoi by cabin bus booked through luxcom.Price is VND150k more than the bus we booked to come to Sapa before and it IS the same bus company. Idk if it’s holiday surge or just travel company scam. Just glad that I made it on time.

.

Living as a foreigner in Vietnam comes with its share of challenges, but nothing could have prepared me for the nightmare I experienced while trying to renew my work permit and visa. What should have been a routine process quickly spiraled into a harrowing ordeal, complete with intimidation from the local police and my landlord's utter incompetence.

For context, my work permit and visa are both critical for staying and working legally in Vietnam. They expire on December 30, 2024, and renewing them involves gathering documents, including a Certificate of Residency from my landlord. While the process is tedious, it’s usually straightforward. Or so I thought.

On November 10, I asked my landlord for the Certificate of Residency. He assured me he’d handle it but then casually dropped a bombshell—he claimed my tenancy contract had already expired, even though I had a copy clearly showing it ended on December 12, 2024. I offered to send him a photo of the contract, but he refused to budge. To avoid conflict, I agreed to sign a new contract, provided it was for seven months instead of six, so I wouldn’t lose out.

He promised everything was fine and said the certificate would follow soon. I believed him, but days turned into weeks, and nothing materialized. Then, one evening, there was a sharp knock at my door. I opened it to find two police officers standing there.

Their presence was overwhelming. In Vietnam, interactions with the police can be intimidating under normal circumstances, but as a foreigner, the stakes felt astronomically higher. My heart was pounding as they demanded to see my passport and legal documents.

I scrambled to gather my paperwork, all the while wondering if I’d done something wrong. Had I overlooked a crucial step? Was I in trouble? The officers sternly explained that my landlord hadn’t registered me with the local authorities for the past year. They inspected every document with piercing scrutiny, and I couldn’t help but feel exposed and vulnerable in my own home.

After what felt like an eternity, the mood shifted. The officers assured me that my legal status was fine and the oversight was entirely my landlord’s fault. They were polite by the end, even sympathetic, but the experience left me shaken.

When I confronted my landlord about this, he dismissed it as ""no big deal."" I reiterated my need for the Certificate of Residency, but he continued to stall, offering one excuse after another. The delays were relentless.

On November 24, he told me he needed my passport for the registration process. I was at work and asked if I could bring it in an hour. His response? “If you don’t bring it now, I can’t guarantee I’ll get your residency certificate.” Panic set in. My residency—and by extension, my ability to work—was hanging by a thread.

I rushed to the police station and handed over my passport. When I asked if I should wait, he waved me off, promising to return it later that day. But then, silence. For a week, he ignored my calls. My passport, the most important document I owned, was being held somewhere, and I had no idea when—or if—I’d get it back.

The fear of being without my passport in a foreign country was overwhelming. I considered involving my embassy but managed to retrieve it through some local connections. However, I was still without the Certificate of Residency.

By December 2, he claimed to have the certificate and promised to deliver it to my workplace. He called me during work hours, and when I couldn’t answer immediately, he left without handing it to anyone. Worse, he took the document with him to his hometown, hours away.

Desperate, I borrowed a car and drove over an hour to retrieve it myself, only to be slapped with a £200 speeding ticket along the way. When I finally submitted my work permit application on December 18, I was running dangerously close to my December 30 deadline.

Then came the ultimate insult. On Christmas Eve, he sent me an ultimatum: “If you don’t have your new visa and work permit by December 28, I’ll cancel your legal residency and evict you.” The audacity was staggering. I reminded him that his negligence had caused the delays and that canceling the contract prematurely would mean refunding me double my deposit, as per the agreement.

He tried to sidestep this by falsely claiming my visa status made me ineligible for the deposit. Immigration and the police had already assured me this wasn’t true, but his threats were still unnerving.

When he demanded more proof, I directed him to my work manager, who could provide the necessary documents. His response? “You are the tenant. It’s your responsibility, not your manager’s.” At that point, I stopped replying.

A few days later 30/12/24:

It was supposed to be a calm day. My girlfriend and I had decided to spend the afternoon at the beach, enjoying the fresh air and a moment of peace before the New Year’s celebrations. I had brought along my fishing gear, hoping to spend some time immersed in nature. My visa was expiring that day, but I’d been reassured previously that there was no issue with my renewal. Everything seemed fine—until 3:00 p.m., when my manager called.

“There’s a problem with your visa application,” he said flatly, offering no solution. My stomach dropped as I realized the severity of the situation. Tomorrow, I’d officially be overstaying, which could lead to deportation or, worse, being blacklisted from Vietnam. Frantically, I checked my phone for flights out of the city, but there were none I could realistically catch in time.

My girlfriend, sensing my panic, immediately started making phone calls to every connection she had—local police, government officials, anyone who could help. Meanwhile, I jumped into the car and raced to my workplace to collect the documents I needed for immigration. Time was against us, but my girlfriend managed to get through to the director of immigration, who agreed to help if I could bring all the necessary paperwork in person.

When I arrived at my workplace, however, things went from bad to worse. Instead of handing over the documents I needed, my employers insisted they could handle everything online. I tried to explain how urgent the situation was, but they ignored me and continued fumbling with the system. Each attempt ended in failure. As the clock ticked closer to the 5:00 p.m. closing time for immigration, I felt the weight of the situation pressing down on me.

My girlfriend arrived shortly after, visibly frustrated. She confronted my employers in Vietnamese, demanding that they hand over the paperwork. After much back-and-forth, they finally called immigration, only to learn that the issue wasn’t just with the application—it stemmed from my landlord. He had failed to register me properly as a tenant, which caused my application to get stuck in the system. My manager was no help, brushing it off as “not ideal” and refusing to do anything further.

With no time to lose, we decided to bypass the landlord and workplace altogether. My girlfriend and I drove straight to the immigration office, hoping they could resolve the issue directly. The staff there were helpful and managed to fix the registration error, but there was a catch. My workplace still needed to sign off on certain documents, and I had to return with the corrected paperwork and a representative from my company before the office closed.

Racing back to my workplace, I pleaded with them to send someone with me to immigration. Once again, they refused, insisting that everything could still be done online. I watched in frustration as they made repeated errors—wrong dates, missing information, incorrect forms. The minutes slipped by, and soon it was well past 5:00 p.m. At 6:05 p.m., an hour after immigration had officially closed, they finally managed to produce a version of the paperwork.

Even then, I wasn’t sure it was correct. Desperate, I convinced one of the staff members to accompany me to the immigration office. We arrived at 6:50 p.m., and by some miracle, a kind immigration officer was still there. She reviewed the documents and immediately spotted more errors. My heart sank—I thought this was it.

But then, against all odds, she decided to help. “You were so close to being deported and blacklisted,” she said. “But we’ll process this for you now.” I could hardly believe it. Just hours earlier, I had been staring down the very real possibility of having to leave everything behind, my job, my girlfriend, and my life in Vietnam.

That night, as we finally returned home, the adrenaline began to wear off, replaced by exhaustion and relief. The experience was a stark reminder of how quickly things can spiral out of control and how important it is to have someone by your side when everything seems to go wrong. If not for my girlfriend’s determination and the kindness of that immigration officer, this story might have ended very differently.",False,False,0.92,"","2024-12-30 12:30:03","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

They mention notarized translation of the USA license but do you also need the passport or any of the other documents notarized or translated?

If you visit a highland market, you will see beautiful young women from different ethnic groups such as the Tay, Nung, and Mong dressed in their traditional finery, before a wide array of colorful brocade and daily merchandise, painting vibrancy for a joyous year-end atmosphere.

Though it has been cold and early to show a brightening dawn in the highlands, murmuring brisk footsteps and laughter, sharing hot exchanges of chitchats among exchangers at farmers' stalls as they buy and sell, create that incredible, unique year-end market atmosphere.

The markets have those things on which the sale reflects the deliquescent forte of the different cultures of these boundless highlands, on linen fabrics and brocade scarves, and on the local delicacies and the tribal instruments like the Lusheng of the Mong people, so diverse are the motives for visiting the highland market. Some come to trade, others to meet friends and chat after working days, while for some, it is simply to keep an eye on a potential lover. All these factors contribute to the uniqueness and beauty of highland markets. Indeed, it is not difficult to see smoke rising from pots of ""thang co,"" where marketgoers gather for a few flavorful bites of fine local dishes.

Highland women visit all the traditional clothing stalls because this will be their last chance to sell. At that market, one can see brightly colored dresses and people talking and exchanging charming smiles, while the lusheng can be heard.

Is car renting a thing in vietnam? Most websites seem to suggest car rental with a driver, which I guess isn't what we want. Seems a pain it's either that, or coach it, or somehow attempt it on bikes, with luggage might be a bit impossible for first timers haha.

I found OAH bridal online and the whole experience was amazing! I knew what I had in mind and sent her multiple inspo pics and she said she could have it made before my wedding.

My dress was $800 and I also asked for pockets and detachable sleeves 

Shipping was $100 and a simple veil was also $100
With a total of $1k

Dress took around 2-3 weeks to be completed and less than a week for delivery ( California)

I've never liked keeping old stuff at home - anything I don't use, I sell it to make room for new things. 😎

After selling various secondhand items from computers to gaming consoles and clothes... I've gathered some experiences to share with you all about how to sell items most effectively! Please check these tips out, and if anyone has good tips, please share them too - it's almost Tet holiday and many people need to sell items for Tet money.

1/ When listing items for sale on FB, Instagram, Cho Tot, etc., you should take complete photos of the product, especially showing any dents, scratches, or wear and tear so potential buyers know upfront. My previous mistake was not taking detailed photos, then when meeting up, buyers would say ""oh it's too scratched"" or ""it's too old"" and try to reduce the price or cancel the deal. Put yourself in the buyer's shoes and take thoughtful photos to save everyone's time.

2/ You should post during 11:30 AM-1:30 PM and 7 PM-10 PM for highest engagement rates. Simple reason: During lunch breaks and evenings, people tend to scroll on their phones more.

3/ Pricing: You should research market prices first to know the approximate value of your item. Most products have existing listings for reference, like iPhones and Android phones are everywhere. After checking, you should price 10-15% higher than your target price so buyers can negotiate down. Remember to note that price is negotiable for serious buyers. You can also check with secondhand shops to know the floor price (as they usually offer the lowest), before posting to find buyers.

4/ Remember to add popular tags like #canmua, #canban - it makes items easier to find in FB search.

5/ Finally, our team is developing a secondhand selling platform called **AiMua247.** If anyone needs to sell items super quickly, try our **AiMua247** product. You won't have to spend time posting everywhere - **AiMua247** uses AI to scan the internet and find people who need your secondhand items very quickly. You can try it on our website: [https://www.aimua247.com/](https://www.aimua247.com/)

My knowledge is limited to these points, hope it helps those who need to sell items before Tet. If anyone has more useful tips, please share with others and I'll learn from them too. And remember to try AiMua247 and give our team feedback! 🥹",False,False,0.5,"","2024-12-28 06:16:02","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

I have a big phobia of mice and am quite upset that this has happened. We spent over $1k on this hotel alone and chose this hotel specifically for its cleanliness, as we understand the level of hygiene and sanitation in VN. 

Staff offered an apology and a fruit platter sent to our room (ironic as it would likely attract the mouse back), but I do not feel this is compensation enough for such a gross situation and that a refund or partial refund would be a more adequate response.

We’ve never been to Vietnam, but we’ve been devouring everything we can about the country – the food, the culture, the coffee – it all looks amazing.

1- How is the weather in Hanoi? Are outdoor activities still enjoyable, or do we primarily stay indoors? We live in the wettest city in England and it just rains nonstop for weeks, very grey and depressing which makes most outdoor activities not very enjoyable.

3- The flat given looks like on a high floor (20th floor). Are there any concerns regarding noise levels or air quality living in a tall building in Hanoi?""

4- What opportunities are there for outdoor adventure activities near Ocean Park, such as hiking, cycling, or water sports?

5- We have lived in the Middle East, Japan, New Zealand and the UK and we are used to extreme heat, high humidity, cold winters, typhoon and gal force. As well as sand, snow and thunder storms. The one that depresses us most is grey clouds and continues rain where the sun is nonexistent for weeks! How would you compare the climate and living conditions in Hanoi to any of those?

6- Is it easy to make local friends, we started learning Vietnamese and as a mixed m-culture couple we are very open to meeting people from everywhere. 

7- we have no dietary requirements and very adventurous when it comes to food. We have taken all the vaccinations required and we have a good health insurance. Does it take long for your stomach to get used to the food without having an upset stomach?

8- just an observation, all the apartments they showed us online have no oven and a small kitchen. Is that because eating out is easy? We can’t afford eating out daily in the UK. ",False,False,0.72,"","2024-12-27 13:07:58","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Hi everyone!  

I’m an independent filmmaker based in Bali, and I’ve just completed a documentary on stateless children in Sabah Malaysia. I’m now looking for compelling stories here in Vietnam to document for my next project.

I recently traveled in Vietnam and had to book two buses for my journey:
	1.	Da Nang to Nha Trang: Limousine 21 Sleeper
	2.	Nha Trang to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City): VIP Cabin

Here’s a breakdown of my experience:

Da Nang to Nha Trang (Limousine 21 Sleeper)
	•	Pros:
	•	Onboard WC (a lifesaver for long trips).
	•	Decent for short or budget-friendly travel.
	•	Cons:
	•	Bed Size: Smaller and might feel cramped, especially if you’re 6ft or taller.
	•	Suspension: Absolutely terrible—be prepared to feel like you’ve been through a rollercoaster. Post-trip, it felt like a hangover for a day! Highly recommend getting a good massage after this ride.
	•	Staff: Friendly but nothing remarkable compared to the VIP Cabin.

Nha Trang to Saigon (VIP Cabin)
	•	Pros:
	•	Onboard WC.
	•	Bed Size: Perfect for a 6ft guy—very comfortable and spacious.
	•	Staff: Much friendlier and accommodating.
	•	Cons:
	•	Slightly pricier, but the comfort is worth it.
Snacks included 


Overall Tips:
	•	If you can splurge a bit, always go for the VIP Cabin—it’s miles ahead in terms of comfort and service.
	•	After a Limousine Sleeper trip, prioritize rest or treat yourself to a massage—it helps with the post-ride fatigue.
	•	Always double-check reviews for bus operators as the quality can vary.
They have USB A ports and not a USB C I would say always carry a power bank 

Hope this helps anyone planning to travel across Vietnam by bus! Safe travels!",False,False,0.88,"","2024-12-27 07:57:11","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Once they got out of the pool, they let the girls go inside to change and dry off but they made the boys stay in the backyard naked until they were ready to shower and sleep. They would also make a lot of jokes and touch their penises (not in sexual ways). 

When everyone was ready to sleep, most of the males wore just tiny underwear and some were butt naked. There was a young adult / teenage boy with pubic hair who was casually naked too so it was not just the boys.

It’s beautiful if you’re not around all the trash but the second you step out of the resorts it’s trash everywhere.

I'm a thrift girlie who loves grungey and unique clothing. I had a blast with my friend visiting different stores in Hanoi last week, I’m so excited to share what I found!!!

I'm making this post because I saw other posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/87zf6u/thriftvintagesecondhand_stores_in_hanoi/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/12gefn1/best_thrift_stores_in_hanoi/) asking for recommendations.

In Tây Hồ district:

1. FRESH by Mountain (sick ski jackets, plus the usual)
2. Makaw (unique balaclavas, super cool crochet octopus hat)
3. PhaseTwo Thrift Store (copped a pair of unique sunnies here)
4. Vintage Stadium (denims, jackets)
5. MOC Thrift Shop (a little harder to find, menswear only, but really good looking jackets)

In Hoàn Kiếm district:

1. Hami Shop New & 2Hand (new?, no reviews yet but they got street items)
2. Xóm Vintage (baggy sweaters, pullovers, pants)
3. Cửa hàng bách hoá số 26 (ig: `cuahangbachhoa`) (mens clothing)
4. The 27 Klub (americana/ cowboy, leather, converse, lots of varsity tees)
5. Chăn Con Công (ig: `chanconcong`) (ugly xmas sweaters, pastel sweaters, cute stuff)
6. The Hood Cafe (ig: `thehood.gang`) (says its a cafe but its a barber shop, monthly thrift venue, tattoo parlor, plus thrifts stuff. I think the cafe biz is the least of it. This place just had so many cool things going on)
7. 400ml Store (ig: `400mlstore`) (""most skibidi rizz shop ive ever mogged into haohio level 10 gyat would recommend"") (skate gear, graffiti, bomber jackets, some techwear, grunge /y2k jewelry, crochet hats, gloves, everything was dope. Highly recommend)

* Cyberslvt Thriftshop (a bit expensive, but super cute Y2K items and an adorable shop cat)
* Culcat (rude, quirky, adorable cartoon cats by local designers)

Advice:

* Prices were all on tags and very transparent
* Expect 400-600k for jackets, 200-400k for tops, 150-300k for accessories
* Bring extra cash, most shops only accept local bank payment OR cash, not credit card

In order to rent a motorbike in Ha Giang is better to have an international driving license (IDP) in general. We rented the motorbike (Honda wave 110) from our homestay. The problem is that Vietnamese police requires IDP with motorbike endorsement which my girlfriend (the only one with IDP) didn't have. 

We decided to go anyway and we were stopped after 3 km. The police immediatly recognised that even though we had IDP, we hadn't motorbike endorsement. At this point they asked us to pay 1.500.000 VND to be able to continue driving through the loop. They took a picture of the driving license and license plate of the bike and told us that we won't need to pay anymore at the further police checkpoints along the loop.
We were suspicius, but when we got stopped again we explained this to the policeman, he phoned someone and let us go in 5 minutes. 
After that we haven't been stopped anymore. Our impression was that there is a system.

In general, if you want to have a better experience (avoid traffic and police too) do the loop counterclockwise. This way you will also tackle the most difficult part of the loop during the first day, and not the last.

Please consider that it is impossible not to be stopped by police, so if you are planning to do this ahead, take the IDP with motorbike endorsement. 

If you don't have the time for that because you decided to do the loop last-minute (as it was for us), don't panic. Vietnamese don't give a fu*k, they just want to be paid. The best assurance is to go slow and the best driving license is 1M DNG. :)",False,False,0.5,"","2024-12-26 13:25:36","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

I guess ridership will be quite significant, removing cars and motobikes from the D2 to D1 route.

There are only two things I just don't get, with regards to the elevated Station Building design :

 \- All those elevated Stations are built following the same blueprint (with the exceptions of Tan Cang and Suoi Tien Terminal stations), which offers only one entrance/exit on one side. That's... not very practical, and contrary to all subways systems having been built anywhere. Was it done to save cost ? The Japanese contractor surely knew better...

\- The biggest elevated station, Tan Cang, sits roughly 400m away from one of the most iconic landmark in the city, the infamous Landmark 81, yet there is no pedestrian access to connect the metro to this tower. How can that be ? Those 2 projects have been designed and built roughly at the same time, yet no city planner ever considered to think about a connection ? That truly baffles me.

Let's hope the network will get bigger and better in the near future !

as far as I see it:



Da Lat: forest, mountains, cloud 9 glamping above clouds, nice sunsets etc, lot of domestic tourists, rather touristy with lot of built attractions, some decent flowers farms. Was in Laos in Nong Khiaw and am swiss, have the feeling I have seen that kind scenery a lot. If we go, then maybe only for one night stay over. Renting a scooter, driving around the nature but not focusing on the city itself. Nature.



Da Nang: more relaxed, baby nomad hub / whereas Chiang Mai and Bali are established, cheaper though, beach main attraction, not a very walkable city like D1/2 saigon, popular nomad spot, good-ish gym/restos. once I work a bit, maybe nice to stay 3-5 days. when the weather is good, maybe a week or so. relax, live a good life here. 



Hoi An: touristy - avoid old town, better beaches than DN? lanterns on river, biking through the rice fields / to beach, walkable, changed a LOT in the last 10 yrs - for the bad, maybe as a day trip from DN or 2 nights max



Hue: citadel, museums, old architecture, least touristy of the cities mentioned here, good food, authentic / local, maybe one night stay



Ninh Binh: good nature, drive around, 2-3 days is advised, Tam Coc is a good place to stay there, feels good for me: ""I did one day tour. You get on the boat they loop you through the scenery and get to stop at a temple and then have the opportunity to climb the mountain"", maybe 2 days and add one day to relax



Hanoi: lot of pullution / smog, political and cultural capital of Vietnam, more conservative/traditional, ""Live in Ho Chi Minh, vacation in Hanoi"", ppl not so friendly / more reserved compared to the south, maybe 3-5 days?



Ha Long Bay: super touristy, must see?

 I want to gauge how much custom leather goods like bags, watch straps, laptops cases, sandals and boots actually cost so that we can estimate how many items we can afford and plan how much money to bring. This is definitely an experience we would like to have but still need to keep within our budget.

Most reviews on google just said reasonable price without sharing the exact price. Reasonable can be very subjective haha. Based on the little reviews that shared how much they paid, in some reviews the prices seems too expensive for us but in others seems like the price is okay.

I also saw a girl on instagram posting she got custom necklace and earrings done in Hoi An as well (I think it is not fine jewellery based on how much she paid). I am interested in this as well but saw this only post about it. Please share your experience and how much you paid if you got custom jewellery.

We are really active couple and looking for exploring the area. We love hiking, kayaking and different activities.

Reading online I have mixed reviews for the Lan Ha Bay cruises - probably you all know what I'm taking about. 

**Why Lan Ha Bay cruise**

3 days / 2 nights  
Example: [https://www.halongbaytours.com/cruise/orchid-cruise/3-days-2-nights.html#itinerary](https://www.halongbaytours.com/cruise/orchid-cruise/3-days-2-nights.html#itinerary) 

\- Interesting experience(we have never done any cruises)  
\- Includes a lot of interesting landmarks  
\- Seems to be ""luxury"" at the same time a lot activities

Concerns: all the activities will be rushed, seems to be food on many cruises rather European than Vietnamese, worth the money, focused on water activities that might be limited due to weather in March?  

**Why Cat Ba Island trip**

2 days / 1 night   
Example: [https://www.catbaventures.com/cat-ba-tours/cat-ba-national-park-trekking-kayaking-2-days-1-night.html](https://www.catbaventures.com/cat-ba-tours/cat-ba-national-park-trekking-kayaking-2-days-1-night.html) 

\- Even more interesting activities vs boat cruise   
\- More time with ""locals"" and get a sense of more ""authentic"" Vietnam  
\- More actual activities than just spending time on a boat  
\- More freedom in a sense you are not restricted by the boat

We (both 33 years old + 2 kids, 4 and 1 years old) are currently considering moving from Germany to VN. My wife is vietnamese, she came to Germany in 2014 for her masters, we met in the same year and came together pretty quickly. Married, made kids. All fine. I have a good job, working as a contractor for customers all around Germany, mostly 100% remote, so I am pretty confident that I can keep a decent income even when moving to VN. Not sure about the legal stuff / work permit needed. My vietnamese is okayish and I am confident that it would be pretty good quickly when moving to VN. We would move to Ba Ria.

Both kids are raised learning german and vietnamese. They both understand vietnamese but talk /reply pretty much only in german. The older kid is already pretty ""germanfied"". So I am afraid that she would struggle in school / child care. The children have only german names and german nationality.

We visited VN multiple times the past \~10 years. There are so many things that make me love VN but just as many that worry me (same accounts for life in Germany). Some of them:

Pros:

* My wife would for sure be more happy in VN. She had difficulties building a social circle in Germany. We dont have much family here. Its pretty lonely. Family in VN is big and many friends. She misses many things from VN.
* I really enjoy the lifestyle in VN. The activities in the evening. The cafes, the food. Also, VN feels much more child friendly than Germany and way more relaxed in general.
* We would have a much bigger house in VN and live ""close"" to the sea.
* The weather

Cons:

* Air pollution, Noise pollution.
* Corruption, unstable politics. No proper health insurance.
* Walkability of VN cities, no public transit. 
* Financial situation in Germany  probably much better.
* Worried about xenophobic sentiments in VN. I read some pretty nasty stuff all around reddit from VN-people complaining about foreigners, Indians, Chinese people and ""whitetrash"". I am not sure if its just a reddit thing, but it feels like the general mood towards foreigners is positive, but could flip pretty quickly to a very negative tone if the community feels like foreigners do not benefit them or if there are some scandals involving foreigners.

From a pretty good (but not great) look at it, I did not see anything that seemed to blatantly indicate it was a toy gun (like an orange tip like they have back home) so I was a bit unsettled by that.

We kept walking and when I looked back again it looked like the grab biker continued on his way either ignoring or not noticing what had just happened…

I guess my question are (1) what are the odds that this was a real gun or was it more likely a toy/fake gun painted black used to scam/rob people? (2) is this at all a common occurrence? I haven’t seemed to see anything similar to this experience from a brief search online…

Students are forced to spend a lot of their time into studying instead of experiencing life. This makes it very tiring for students (me too).  
2. We have to studying things that don't even need/want to  
I totally agree with the idea that students should learn the basics the most subjects so they can have the need fundamentals for future things (more advanced courses, jobs, budgeting,...) but I think everything till 5th grade is enough for the basics, then from 6th grade onwards us students should be allowed to choose what subjects we want to take. Some subjects don't feel like ""fun"" for me, and to me, studying them is just a waste of time. I mean, If we are allowed to learn what we like, certainly we'll be more focused and put a lot more effort into those subjects.  
3. Too much homework  
I'm sure pretty much everyone can understand this. With the addition of presentations (that we of course don't want at all), homework is becoming more like a burden.  
4. Too many tests  
Those tests really take a toll on my mentality. I feel extremely obsessed with grades, and when sometimes I can't get a 10 on my midterms/finals, I start to feel like I'm dumb, or stupid (maybe because I'm a perfectionist) than everyone else. And I also detest memorizing the answers to the question in the exams, I can only get full marks if I answered exactly the same as the teachers told us. Furthermore, subjects like Citizen Education, Histories and Geography, Technology, and Informatics shouldn't have tests, just letting the students know about these for me is enough. (I'm just gonna forget everything I've learned after those tests anyway; And that's why I like Maths and Literature for not requiring us to memorize the answer, but rather actually letting ourselves to think and answer the questions in our own way to get high marks)  
5. Honourable mention: Citizen Education (GDCD)  
Don't get me wrong, the subject itself is really useful for students, but the way the teacher is teaching us and the assignments + exams are just annoying.  
Our GDCD teacher is kinda strict to be honest, sometimes she just assign group homework for us, and because of the high HW load + basically we're just too tired to even those assignments, we, of course, hate this. But the actual painful part is those exams. We need to answer the questions with respect to a certain format, if we don't follow the format exactly how it is, marks deducted. For some special questions, like ""What do you think about some quote by some famous person?"", the answer is just ridiculously long and it's the only correct answer to that question, if you don't write exactly as it is, low grades it is then (I think).  
6. Too few benefits for gifted students (lower secondary schools)  
Personally I think just adding some points to your ""vào 10"" exam grades is not enough. I just participated in the district's HSG contest and got a third prize, and I'm really working hard for the city's contest (in Informatics, or coding btw). But my schedule's all packed because of all of the above, so it's getting really hard for me to practice, especially when the contest is in half a month and there's also my finals coming up...  So I think myself and other gifted students (actually I don't think I'm ""gifted""...) deserves more for their effort if they achieved good results in the city's contest. 

So apparently finals is in a week, we have a GDCD ""Đề cương"" and group assignment that needs to be finished tomorrow, and I'm already too tired with the other subjects' ""Đề cương"", but we gotta finish the thing so the teacher will correct our ""answers"". I just can't take this, I feel frustrated from all of this drama and just hate school. Somebody help-

- I’ve read the city is very safe for tourists, but are there any particular areas to avoid? Also is carrying a Swiss Army knife legal?

- Should I be carrying my passport with me at all times? I’ve heard people say tourists should have identification on them (especially passports) whenever they’re out and about in new countries (never needed to do this to ngl) 

- I’ve heard grab is a great app for taxi, what is the Vietnamese equivalent of uber eats? Also might sound silly, how do I get an eSIM card? 

- Are buses in Hanoi punctual/good form of transportation? Also is walking (30 minute commute) feasible? I’ve heard footpaths tend to not be very walking friendly. 

- Would you suggest Airbnb or a hotel for the stay? While I’d like to be kind to my wallet if staying in a hotel is safer then I’d obviously prioritise safety first. 

- Above all, what is your favourite restaurant in Hanoi? The only reason for choosing Vietnam for my elective was to gorge on your incredible food!

I just had an amazing (but now bittersweet) trip to Southeast Asia. I’ve been traveling for the past few months, capturing unforgettable memories with my drone. Everything from the temples in Myanmar to the rice terraces in Vietnam—my drone was my companion, helping me document this once-in-a-lifetime journey.

Yesterday, I was in Ha Long Bay, mesmerized by the emerald waters and limestone karsts. I wanted to capture the perfect shot, so I sent my drone out over the bay. But as I was bringing it back, disaster struck—I misjudged the height of a branch sticking out from a cliffside, and my drone crashed into it. I watched helplessly as it tumbled down into a dense area of foliage on one of the islands.

I spent hours trying to figure out a way to recover it, but the spot was completely inaccessible without proper equipment. The drone itself I can let go of, but what breaks my heart the most is losing the memory card with all the footage I’d taken from this trip.

If anyone happens to live in the area or knows someone who could help recover it, I’d be beyond grateful. The exact coordinates it fell is: 20.848945, 107.095262 at the top of one of the mountains in the bay where everyone goes kayaking in Ha Long Bay. I’m happy to provide more details, coordinates, and a $1000 reward for anyone willing to help.

I’m looking for anyone that might have a bit more info on this weird experience me and my wife had this morning. 

I have been living in Vietnam for over a year now, married this amazing girl. Life has been really good for me, for us.

Anyways I was just browsing batdongsan because I have had thoughts about how nice it would be to have our own place. We’ll renovate it, turn it into a dream home for us and our cat.

Well I see such amazing properties, these typical 2-3 storey long and skinny “tube” shop houses you find everywhere in Vietnam. They were selling for 3-4billion vnd in d1, in d3, etc. Compare this to most vinhome apartments going for 6-9billion vnd.

Well we contacted these ads, and they all wanted to meet either tues or fri morning at their “office”. We went to the first office at d1. It was held in a big ballroom style room in the military museum next to the Saigon zoo on le duan . It was very bizarre. There were so many tables arranged as far as the eye can see, real estate agents wearing formal shirts and ties, takoyaki and cake on tables for “us”. We were ushered to a table to be sat opposite 2 of these real estate agents that start making small talk with my wife. It reminded me so much of the timeshare sales presentations my dad used to get sucked into back in Bali during my younger days.
We’re kinda freaked out by this and it felt like they were playing some game. I’m not sure what to think.

We left and went to different other meeting for a different batdongsan ad, this time in d3. I rmbr the address this time at 60 vo van tan. Lo and behold, same situation. Large hall with tables and chairs arranged the entire length of the room. Directed to a table of 2 real estate agents. This time there was a middle aged viet lady who joined us. They said this lady was a “repeat customer” and they were understaffed and she’s also looking for real estate in the same category and budget as us so she is joining our table. I looked around and there were so many numerous empty tables occupied only by 2 real estate agents. This lady then has a short conversation with the agents about how excited she is to invest and it felt like this conversation was purposely said for us to hear. I don’t know what to think honestly.

This time we stayed a bit longer at this meeting to try decipher what’s up. They mentioned the property we are looking at is given to soldiers who fought the Vietnam war and the land lease was expiring in 2048. They suggested an alternative property 30km outside hcmc which they said is “residency for life” that you can live in forever. He then pulled out this map on a website with a map of Saigon colour coded and said the orange areas are “govt land” and the pink areas are “residency land” that cost more but solves this 2048 expiration problem. My understanding is that all land is subject to this 50 year land lease? They can be renewed every 50 years but are subject to govt taking it away if they wanted to build a road through the land or develop a new museum or any other govt use right? Furthermore, they said there was no original pink book or red book, and mentioned something about a “written guarantee”. They also suggested some sort of profit sharing scheme about how we buy the land 30km away, rent it to them and they’ll pay us some sort of rent every 6 months? Bizarre. The lady left to go see the original property (I think? It was very unclear). We said we would like to maybe see the original property as well, and the real estate agents told my wife we can’t today but what about Saturday? We said sure and left. My wife doesn’t think we’ll hear from them.

This is raising all sorts of red flags isn’t it?! Anyone at all know what this is? Is this legit? I’m thinking not, but maybe I’m just a foreigner?

Edit: autocorrect corrected hcmc to Hancock. Oops.

Either way we’re not interested in buying any real estate for investments. We’re aware of how bad of an investment it would be.

Just wanted to know if there is still a Vietnamese-Indian community in Vietnam?

I was born and raised in Europe but my family is mixed and comes from Vietnamese and Indian descents. This mixing goes back to the 1910’s/1920’s. 
My grandparents were already mixed and lived in Saigon until the 1970’s and fled the country at the end of the war. 

So I grew up only speaking Vietnamese (my grandparents never teach our parents Tamil) with Vietnamese and Indian cuisine (so Pho on Saturday and Cari with paratha on Sunday). I have cultural heritage from both countries. 

There was only a little community of Indian-Vietnamese in Saigon back then. I know that the majority of them fled to Europe/France during the 60’s/70’s. I grew up with lots of people from our mixed community. But due to westernised lifestyle, this heritage is going extinct now. 

To have a little history background on that, I suggest the book from Pairaudeau Natasha, « Mobile citizens. French Indians in Indochina, 1858–1954 » (it was during French colonisation). 

Also, my other parent is from another SE Asian country, to add another cultural heritage (another dish on Friday). Yeah, there are lots of different celebrations in my family.

We see the main attractions of Hoi An

My advice would be to opt for dotted designs of ethnic minority products in Vietnam, as they are plentiful and highly diverse, with designs that practically guarantee uniqueness. You can either buy them or make them during your travels. I also want to mention some of the names and techniques used in creating ethnic patterns by ethnic communities in Vietnam.

Often associated with the traditional costumes of highland women, brocade patterns are a unique cultural feature of Vietnam's ethnic communities. Before the widespread use of industrial fabrics and chemical dyes, brocade patterns were meticulously handcrafted using techniques passed down through generations.

1. Embroidery: Embroidery is a popular technique among ethnic groups in the Northern mountains, as women can easily carry their embroidery with them and work on it anywhere—at home, in the fields, at the market, or while out and about. Girls start learning embroidery at a very young age and are often proficient by the time they are 12 or 13. This technique is widely applied to various types of brocade patterns.

Using embroidery techniques, people can create natural curves in their designs. The Hmong people, for instance, use cross-stitch embroidery to form multiplication sign patterns, while the Dao and Thai communities primarily rely on threading and weaving techniques. Traditional embroidery patterns are memorized and passed down from generation to generation, preserving their cultural heritage.

2. Batik: Batik is a “cover-dyeing” technique in which parts of the fabric are covered before dyeing to create intricate patterns. This technique is commonly practiced by the Hmong and Dao Tien communities.

People create patterns on fabric using melted beeswax. The drawing tools include special pens with curved copper tips, triangular stamping frames, and small bamboo tubes.

When the wax is dry, the fabric is dyed with indigo several times, then dipped in boiling water until the wax is completely dissolved. The bright patterns that were covered with wax to protect them before dyeing will appear on the dark indigo fabric.

3. Fabric patching: Popular among some ethnic groups in the Northern mountains, fabric patching is a technique of creating patterns by sewing many small pieces of colored fabric onto a base fabric. The fabric for patching has different colors, is cut into triangles, squares, rectangles, etc., and then sewn onto the base fabric, the stitches are hidden on the back so as not to reveal the stitches.


Each ethnic group often has its own style of patchwork. The Lo Lo and Pu Peo patchwork triangles. The Hmong have a very sophisticated technique of patchwork called “reverse patchwork”, which means the patchwork is cut into curved patterns and then patched onto the garment to reveal the background color underneath.


4. Ikat: In the ikat or “fiber bag dyeing” technique, people use bark fibers or nylon threads to wrap around bundles of fibers at different sections and then dye them. The wrapped parts of the fibers will not take on color. The wrapping-dyeing process is repeated many times to create multi-colored fibers, which are used as weft threads to weave ikat fabric.


Some places use the “yarn dyeing” technique to process the yarns that will be woven onto the loom to make warp yarn. The ikat technique is popular among the Black Thai, Khmer, Ba Na… Ikat patterns have a very unique beauty thanks to the blurred borders.

5. Weaving: In weaving techniques, to create patterns, people add a horizontal thread that is different from the base thread. This additional horizontal thread is inserted between the vertical threads using two different techniques: either the thread runs across the width of the fabric, or only in the intended decorative position.

The weaver works on the wrong side of the fabric. The loom can be a large foot-operated loom, like that of the Thai or Muong people, or the “Indonesian” style of the ethnic groups in the Central Highlands.

These looms have two basic rows of hems and auxiliary hems or small sticks used to separate the warp threads and insert auxiliary weft threads to create patterns. The more complex the pattern, the more auxiliary hems are needed.",False,False,0.96,"","2024-12-23 10:19:11","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

For a quick background I am a North American expat F(32) living in Southeast Asia who will be bringing my Mother F(60) around. My mother is based in North America and has lived in Southeast Asia 10 years. We have both travelled quite extensively around Southeast Asia - I have been to Vietnam 5x, 2x in the last year, and she has been to Vietnam only once. 

Things we enjoy 
- Food - 
Street food and restaurants. I’ve reserved one night in Da Nang to have 4P’s because I am obsessed, but we also love trying street food. 
- History & Art - 
Anything like museums, galleries, ruins, or temples
- Convenience and Walkability - 
We love wandering around cities and exploring, good sidewalks & walking paths are important to us 
- Nature - 
We love hiking and the outdoors. My mom is in great shape for 60, so most moderate difficulty hikes shouldn’t be a problem. 


Things we will avoid 
- Backpacker Culture - 
Loud bars, balloons, and touristy bars. Big no from us 
- “Fake” feeling touristy places - 
The type that have like Disneyland / theme park vibes..we will probably avoid Bana Hills for this reason 
- Beach Resorts - 
We’re tired of beaches and prefer to be walking around exploring over lounging on a beach. 
- Shopping - 
Will probably not be seeking out shopping on this trip, especially the type of tour bus scams where they drop you at a “silk farm” or “coffee farm” 

Based on this profile, what agenda do you all recommend? I’m going between: 

1. Da nang (4 days) - can maybe day trip to Hoi An 
2. Da nang (2 days) + Hoi An (2 days) 
3. Da nang (2 days) + Hue (2 days)

The airport fee INCLUDED in the price you are quoted on Grab. I would say good practice in general is to not pay any Grab drivers for anything they ask for via cash if you booked them on the app to pay by credit card.

Today we left HCMC airport via the Domestic terminal in a Grab and on the way out, our driver told us we needed to pay for the international terminal airport fee as well as the domestic airport fee because he came from the international terminal to pick us up at the domestic terminal. I used google translate to ask why I have to pay the international terminal fee if I landed in the domestic terminal and he laughed and then responded saying okay nevermind and then asked us to just pay just the domestic terminal fee. At that point I stopped responding to him while my husband and I were googling on our phones and talking to each other about how we thought the airport fee was included in the Grab price. 

I think he caught wind that we weren’t going to be an easy target & oblige so he ended up writing a sob story about how he was just trying to recover the fees he paid coming from the international terminal and that he was only making $3 USD from our grab ride. He then tried to rectify the situation by saying “no problem no problem” to try and cover his butt because he was probably scared we would report him on the app and he’d get kicked off. We just ignored his last message and he didn’t push it any further and dropped us off at our hotel. 

First of all, he’s the one who voluntarily accepted to take our ride (so nobody forced him to move from the international terminal to the domestic terminal) and in addition, I don’t see why he wouldn’t have been paid for the international terminal fee via his last ride if he had dropped somebody off previously (unless he was just lingering around the international terminal waiting without having dropped anybody off earlier). 

Anyway, I plan on reporting him on Grab after I leave Saigon in 2 days. I’m a bit afraid to report him right now because he knows where we are staying and I’m afraid he’ll linger around and wait for us to enter/exit the hotel and retaliate in some way. 

Hope this helps somebody else to not fall for this trick. 

EDIT: I just reread the message Grab sent and says the airport fee will be automatically added to the total and deducted from your credit card upon completion of the trip. So the airport fee is NOT part of the initial quoted cost. However, the point I was trying to make is that you should not be paying the airport fee directly to your driver via cash if you booked the ride to be charged to your credit card as the fee will be part of your total charged to your card at the end.

However, I am struck by how overwhelmingly negative most comments are about Vietnam. The general sentiment seems to be:
- You’ll get scammed—go to Thailand.
- The beaches are dirty—go to Thailand.
- The traffic is terrible—go to Thailand.
- The food is good—yet better in Thailand.
- Paperwork is all about bribery—don’t move here.
- The government is becoming more oppressive—don’t move here.

(The most ironic part of it is: I hesitated between Vietnam and Thailand and gave the first a chance)

There’s hardly any positivity in the comments, which feels like a stark contrast to what I’ve seen in subs for other countries.

I’ve been a mid-term tourist in Japan and South Korea, and I currently even have a WHV for both. In their respective subs, while people do criticize certain aspects (like work culture, sexism or over-tourism), there’s still a lot of love for those countries. It’s not black and white, but the tone is far more positive overall.

So back story, I’ve been talking to this woman from Saigon for about a year now. It was just friendly in the beginning and felt more like just a cultural exchange. But as we talk more, I started to have real feelings for her and vice versa. Now we are talking to each other like a couple. Still haven’t met her physically but I will soon on my planned trip.
How we started to talk to each other was that she tried to add me on FB/IG. I normally don’t just add anyone unless I know them. But knowing that I already had a trip planned to Vietnam, I accepted her invitation to maybe have a personal insight to Vietnam.
After being her friend on her social media, I also saw that she had many many foreign men on her friends lists. She’s a pretty girl. Attractive. And I see many of those western men just “liking” all of her pictures, leaving comments, etc. 
So in my head, I automatically went to “oh she’s one of those who wants to marry a foreign man to GTFO of Vietnam to have a better life”. Again, I hate to generalize but hearing horror stories about these kind of marriages and immediate divorces after they get their green card, I had no other reference but to go to that mind set. 
I called her out. I told her that I’m not stupid or naive if she was hunting. Whether she did or not, it doesn’t change my feelings for her. But she just won’t admit that she was hunting. She says it’s just to learn English. Ok… but there are western women who can teach her English… why don’t you have western women friends? She just won’t admit. I mean if she wasn’t hunting, I wouldn’t be here talking about this. 

So I guess the question is, am I over thinking this? Can I really trust her? Is this another hoax and will be a green-card marriage? ",False,False,0.2,"","2024-12-22 18:55:14","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

My partner and I will be visiting Vietnam for a little over 3 weeks in April and May next year. We're looking forward to it a lot and are currently assembling a high-level itinerary. We've been reading some travel guides (online and books) and we've come to what I've pasted below. We'd love to get some feedback on our plans. Perhaps we're skipping things we shouldn't be skipping, or spending too much time in places. At this point the only things set in stone are the arrival and departure dates, as well as the flight from Hanoi to HCMC (May 8th). Apart from that, the rest is still only a concept.

We're also very much open to suggestions on activities in the various locations. We made the conscious decision to skip Ha Long Bay, as many people indicate it's a always busy and has gotten polluted recently. We also included Phong Nha in an earlier version of the itinerary, but decided to remove it as traveling there takes a significant amount of time.

Many, many thanks in advance for taking the time to read this through and give some feedback on our plans!

I would like to visit Hoi An/Da Nang but want to be realistic about what to expect weather wise and if it’s just not a good time of year to visit.

Is there a coastal town with nice nature that's accessible from Hanoi? I don't need to swim, just want to chill and appreciate the scenery.

Cat Ba seems like a good option but I've already been there just a few days ago and would prefer something new. Quan Lan would be perfect but getting there seems a hassle. Any other places I could check out?

I live in America and can't really afford to live here anymore, nor do I enjoy it or the path it has taken for the 45 years I've been alive.

  
I have decided that Vietnam would be a nice place to live, but need experienced advice and words of wisdom from people who live or have lived there.

  
First off, I read you need to be in good health. 



I have Diabetes Type 1, will that be an issue and will I be able to obtain insulin. I currently use a pump and a sensor that go on my body and ""talk"" to each other. Is access to something like that possible, (not a deal breaker, but I am negligent managing my blood sugar and the pump helps dramatically.) I have gone through Ketoacidosis in the past, mostly as a result of what I mention below, but this has only happened once (even once can be quite deadly or land you in a permanent coma, however.) This actually happened due to what I mention below, but this isn't mentioned on the records of it. It just looks like I didn't manage my blood sugar.

  
More of an issue is that since I was born I have had mental health issues to the point of being on disability since 2002. Pardon my frankness, but while I am not a danger to others, I have attempted to end my life multiple times. This hasn't happened in years, and my meds have stabilized, but I do need a psychiatrist that can speak English, and preferably a Therapist who can also speak English, as well as access to my current meds, or at the least something very similar. (My body is very resistant with many many meds and it took a long time for me to find a good combination. For example, extended release medication simply does not work on me at all.)

  
I hear there is a lot of stigma to mental illness in VIetnam, will it still be possible to obtain my meds and find a psychiatrist, if not also a therapist? One of the meds I am on is Adderall, is that obtainable there?

  
I have heard that if you have mental health issues you will want to hire a lawyer when attempting to move to Vietnam, does anyone know what my chances are and roughly what a lawyer like that tends to charge in Florida in the US?

  
I realize I can't be on disability moving to Vietnam. I did not finish college, but I have experience to a great degree with English, and could teach it, up to a more advanced level, or English Literature, as I am well read in the classics, at least those from the West. I have no problem working, the issue here is that disability is structured in a way that tends to keep you in its clutches. Were I to get a job here, I would lose my health insurance, my paid doctors' visits, hospital visits, and my medication, which would mean I would find myself in the same situation that got me on disability in the first place. Then who knows if I could get back into the system, as I was put on it around 2002, and it seems like it was easier to get on it then. Everyone I know now who applies gets denied the first time at least, no matter what their situation is.

  
I hear that if I can get a job as an English teacher, it pays well. I also have a good grasp of the programming language C#, though there are gaps in my knowledge that make it something that would be hard for me to teach anything but maybe an entry level class for, even then those gaps mean I might struggle to answer some questions. Nothing hunting down a lesson plan wouldn't prevent, of course. I also have nautical stars tattoo'd on my hands and a Legend of Zelda tattoo on the back of my neck. Will these be a problem? I have a lot of piercings, but am willing to take them out to pursue this.

  
I have never been a teacher before, and I do not speak Vietnamese, or even French, (I hear that can help.) I also hear to obtain a Work Visa I need to have a job waiting for me there. How does one actually go about that?

  
I am not looking for luxury, so my living expenses should be small. My goal, if anyone wants to strike up communications for a potential plan a few years in the future, is to at least initially have a roommate in an affordable apartment, (none of that luxury expat stuff..) This person would be someone I would need to help me in one way, namely by going to doctors' appts with me and translating for me. (Again, I don't want to go to the expensive expat hospitals where it is more likely the Doctors will speak English, as the idea is to save money for stability and just to keep my overhead low in general.)

  
Lastly, I am vegan. How affordable/easy is it to be vegan in Vietnam? And for all the things I mentioned, what cities would you recommend moving to? How readily available are a wide variety of fruits, nuts, beans, and vegetables? If there is nutmilk like soymilk and oatmilk, is it fortified in any way?

  
Sorry for the long post, but I probably haven't even covered all my questions yet, just the ones I can remember. Thank you for your time.

So now my journey went to Hanoi. came late, half past 23:00. was restless after a day of traveling so i went out. I was not aware of the temptations hitting me. Coke, pills alcohol and scammers everywhere. So I spent another week drunk out of my mind. 

No I realize my plans, to go to the northern part to find solitude in nature is lost cause my budget is basically just enough to get home.

point is Hanoi was way too overwhelming, couldn't fint my way back to the hotel if I went further than 100m away, girls, scammers and dealers pulling ur arm. I didn't expect that.

So this was my so far experience with Vietnam. Lost, overwhelmed and even scared if i get stranded cause now I'm drinking again. The embassy can't help me, my family refuse and God sure won't. I'm too big a sinner for that.

First of all, the weather is cool, not as cold as winter in the North of VietNam, in the early morning 20 Dec 2024, it is around 13°C, upto 20°C in mid-day, for a person who has some health problems like me, I enjoy living without air conditioner, my nose feels good with the weather here, also the city is not polluted
Second, I enjoy a lot of good foods here, food here is not the best of the country, but with the good weather, plus friendly + harmless people, I always enjoy good coffee, local foods, going out without worrying about anything, I have never lost anything here during 2 years live here.
Third, I can easily access to nature site, area if I want to without any struggle, of course I have a bike
So DaLat is a city for those who like to enjoy the weather (DaLat is likely little Europe to some people), want to spend time with nature and enjoy little beautiful things in life.

\-Literally nothing really to do entertainment wise.......except maybe see some churches and visit some coffee shops?

\-Pollution is pretty terrible

\-Everyone honking their horn just pisses you off

\-Nearly same prices (or even higher) than thailand and even japan for most things but quality is much lower, take meat for example in their version of 7-11, C2GO or something, wouldn't touch it compared to fried chicken you find in japan 7-11. ---I think this one suprised me the most, Vietnam as a reputation of being 'extra cheap value destination' but most things like one day gym passes, grab meals, decent hotels, are more expensive

Oh and local police has my my zalo in case someone finds it and brings it to a station, hopefully someone does this, it's basically the only realistic way of getting it back. 

Plan for tomorrow is now to back track and see if I can find it on the roadside. obviously chances for that are slimm to null, but if you don't look you won't find. Crazier things have happened already.......
If not I'll drive to hue the next day and park my bike at a hostel for a week (hope they understand given  the situation) and take a night bus to hanoi so I can start the process of getting a provisional passport from the consulate there, it should be about 7- 10 days wait because of Christmas.

The fields and meadows of our homeland waved us off in quiet farewell, as birds and trees stood witness to our march. However, I would later come to realize a harsh and bitter truth: war is not the place where men become legends, as the elders had preached. It is a realm of savagery, ruled by tyrants who sound the horns of battle, and peasants who fight desperately to survive on scorched and barren ground.

In the brief span of a week, we arrived at the Van Lang imperial camp, only to be greeted by devastation. The camp was in shambles: wounded soldiers groaned in pain, their sweat and blood soaking the place. Some had arrows embedded deep in their shoulders, hastily wrapped in filthy rags. The stench of rotting corpses and festering wounds assaulted my senses, and waves of nausea overtook me repeatedly—I lost count of how many times I staggered into the woods to vomit. And yet, our plight didn’t end there. The enemy camped just a mile away and constantly threatened us. Each night, their wretched archers took down several of our men, and those of us who ventured into the forest to hunt for food often fell victim to ambushes. It had seemed hopeless and futile.

But finally, the Van Lang soldiers could wait no longer. They saw an opportunity to bring the war with the Shang dynasty invaders to a bloody conclusion and seized it. On that decisive morning, the roar of battle cries tore through the morning air as our forces charged downhill, driven by a hatred that seemed to consume all reason. The enemy, caught off guard, retaliated with a relentless rain of arrows. Within moments, dozens—no, hundreds—of our soldiers fell, their bodies scattered like fallen leaves.

I still remember the image of the blacksmith from my village. He was struck by dozens of arrows, his blood flowing in streams across the earth. Some of it splattered onto my iron armor, still warm and vivid. As time dragged on, the number of casualties mounted. Despair swelled in the hearts of both sides, and the cries of agony shattered the silence of the once-green hills now stained crimson.

Eventually, we broke through the Shang’s lines. In a blind fury, I drew my stick and beat out at the soldiers fleeing before me—small, pitiful figures in the chaos. My blows grew faster, and harder until the ground around my horse was littered with mutilated bodies. Some bore massive bruises and shattered bones; others had their skulls crushed, their brains splattered amidst the dirt. When my weapon broke, I tore a branch from a bamboo grove and continued to strike, rage pulsing through my veins like fire.

My iron steed, too, became an unstoppable force, spewing flames that scorched the enemy’s war chariots and engulfed those who cowered in trenches. Soldiers ran, and wreathed in fire, before collapsing to the ground. The stench of charred flesh mingled with the metallic tang of blood, painting a nightmarish scene of hell on earth.

Our victory was decisive, but the euphoria of triumph quickly gave way to revulsion. We captured dozens of prisoners, yet my heart was heavy with shame. I spurred my iron horse away from the battlefield, overwhelmed by a storm of anger, horror, and self-loathing. The grotesque images of the battle haunted me: the blacksmith’s lifeless eyes staring at nothing, severed heads rolling like overripe fruit, and the endless streaks of blood that marred the grassy plains.

Ahead lay an open sky, vast and untainted—a stark contrast to the carnage I had just witnessed. My iron steed galloped with impossible speed, crushing thorns and rocks beneath its feet. I screamed though I didn’t know why. Was it fury? Grief for the men who couldn’t return to their homes? Or an attempt to silence the fear and guilt clawing at my chest? The flames from my horse no longer symbolized victory; they burned with the inescapable guilt of war.

As we reached the summit of the final mountain, the iron horse’s heavy steps grew light. It seemed to shed its chains, and a blinding light engulfed us both. I knew then that this was no longer the realm of mortals. There were no more clashing swords, no more stench of blood, no more agony to torment my soul.

Yet when I looked back, I saw a land cloaked in eerie silence. The fields of battle were now ash-strewn graveyards, the villages lifeless, their children’s laughter silenced. I wanted to cry out, but invisible wings lifted me higher, beyond the reach of the earthly world.

Below, the fields still smoldered, a grim reminder of war’s unyielding brutality. No one wins in war. The righteous and the wicked alike become sacrificial lambs to the greed of tyrants. Brothers from opposing hills slay each other while their wives and children weep for the fathers and husbands now becoming lifeless souls.

Though I fought for justice, I was ensnared in the endless cycle of destruction. In the end, my body dissolved into the wind, leaving behind a legend that would echo through millennia. But I wondered: would they remember the screams of the battlefield, the eyes of fallen comrades? Or would they only glorify Saint Giong, the hero who rode his iron horse into the heavens?

And so, I vanished, taking with me the haunting memories and guilt of that war, leaving behind a scarred earth that will never heal.

But my rental scooter for damaged, the axes broke, the other scooter was fine.
The lady left the scene after 2 minutes and I got help from some locals calling a truck to get the scooter back to my homestay.

So I got back to my homestay and the lady at the homestay said that the repair guy will come tomorrow to see what is actually broken

My question is:
 who is paying for the damage?
They must have some kind of insurance for the scooter + the crash was not my fault (the Vietnamese lady just crossed the street without honking or even looking. I know that this might not matter)

Will the lady from the homestay make me pay or should I tell her that her insurance has to cover it (I talked to some Vietnamese people on the market after the crash and they said that the homestay should pay for the repair)

I’m looking for advice to make the most of my time in Vietnam. Here’s the deal: I’m waiting for my Japanese work visa from dec 21 to around feb 15. I’ve been to HCMC, Hanoi, and Ha Long Bay before, so I want to mix it up this time.

# Current plan:

* 4 nights in HCMC: 
* 2 weeks in Phú Quốc:
   * 1 week in Sunset Town. (Ik its a ghost town, dont know how I'll feel about it)
   * 1 week on Long Beach. (Planning to relax, enjoy the beach, explore, and work remotely these 2 weeks)

# Unsure about:

* I wanted to spend 2 weeks in Da Nang, but January weather isn’t great for swimming, so I’m thinking of skipping it.
* Should I extend my stay in Phú Quốc, or should I mix it up and explore elsewhere? Scared Phú Quóc could be boring for more than 2 weeks. Idkkkk

# Considering other spots:

* Ninh Binh, Ta Xua, Sa Pa, etc.: I hear they’re amazing, but January is not the best time IMO
* Farm stays/animal interactions: I’d *love* to experience a farm stay with animals somewhere warm. Does anyone know of good spots in Vietnam?

# Open to Ideas beyond Vietnam:

* I’ll have 2 months free in total and would love to explore somewhere new and close which in my case is just Laos or China. I really want to do China, but I need a tourist visa and have return tickets, hotels booked and I have no idea when my visa will be ready so it's not ideal, and Laos idk, it doesn't look very interesting to me after doing all of SEA.

We are debating catching the train - it would be much easier on me I think but I wanted to ask:

Will the stretch from Sapa to Nimh Binh be scary for me if I take a bus?  Will they be driving crazy and close to the edge of scary drops?   
  
Are smaller vans better for this than big busses?

Hai vợ chồng mình là du học sinh đã tốt nghiệp và hiện đang sống và làm việc ở một nước Châu Âu. Gần đây mình suy nghĩ rất nhiều về việc ở hay về do mình chuẩn bị đón bé đầu lòng. Trong vài năm tới trước khi bé đi học mình phải ra quyết định để tránh ảnh hưởng đến môi trường học tập của bé. 

Kế hoạch của 2 vợ chồng nếu ở lại thì mình sẽ phải ở lại đến ít nhất khi bé vào đại học. Năm đấy cả 2 đứa mình 48t, nếu may mắn thuận buồm xuôi gió thì dự kiến trả góp hết nhà và có khoảng 1tr eur saving. Như vậy con mình được học hành môi trường tốt, có một cuốn hộ chiếu mạnh và căn nhà để dành. 

Nếu về VN bây giờ thì chắc chắn tiền kiếm khó hơn và công việc áp lực hơn nhiều. Nhìn giá nhà ở HN và HCM, giá học phí các trường tốt mà thấy sợ. Gia đình cả 2 bên đều không giúp được gì nhiều. Thế nhưng mình lại được ở gần bố mẹ, bạn bè, họ hàng. Con mình cũng có thể nói tiếng Việt và gắn bó với quê hương hơn. 

Mình nghĩ nhiều không biết có nên đánh đổi cuộc sống ổn định nhưng cô đơn ở nước ngoài để về gần nhà không. Bọn mình có rất ít bạn bè. Thường chỉ đi làm và một năm du lịch vài lần. Bản thân mình sống 5,6 năm rồi nhưng chưa bao giờ thấy thuộc về nơi này. Không biết sau này con mình có hạnh phúc không nếu mình ở lại.

If anyone also has a list or link to other posts breaking down all of the costs associated on the VN side in order for the spouse to leave the country for the UK in this instance then I will be grateful.

Reading some other posts and it seems varied or very complicated. Does it make any difference if I was born in VN but left the country as a baby?

Edit*** 

I've attached a copy below of the message she must've copied online or been sent by someone - (fees have gone up)

''When a Vietnamese person marries a British person and wants to apply for a spouse visa to settle in the UK, the total costs to prepare include the following:

1. Visa application fee

• Spouse Visa (Partner Visa) fee:

• £1,538 (equivalent to 46-48 million VND, depending on the exchange rate).

This is the application fee from Vietnam and is non-refundable if the application is rejected.

2. Health insurance fee (IHS - Immigration Health Surcharge)

• This fee is required to use the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK during the 2.5-year visa period:

• £624/year x 2.5 years = £1,560 (equivalent to 47-49 million VND).

3. Health check (TB Test - tuberculosis test)

• This is a mandatory requirement for Vietnamese people applying for a visa to settle in the UK.

• Cost: about 2-3 million VND, performed at a facility designated by the British Embassy.

4. Translation and notarization of documents

• Documents that need to be translated into English and notarized include:

• Birth certificate, marriage certificate, criminal record, household registration, financial documents (if necessary), etc.

• Translation cost: 150,000 - 250,000 VND/page.

• Notarization cost: 30,000 - 50,000 VND/copy.

• Total: 3-5 million VND, depending on the number of documents.

5. Criminal record fee

• Criminal record number 2 (mandatory): about 200,000 - 300,000 VND.

6. Visa application center fee (TLScontact)

• If using additional services (document scanning, priority service):
• Support fee ranges from 500,000 - 2 million VND, depending on the service package.

7. Travel and document sending costs

• Including travel costs for health check, submitting documents at TLScontact center, and sending documents if needed.

Estimated: 1-3 million VND.

Total cost of self-application

1. Visa fee: ~ 46-48 million VND.

2. Health insurance fee (IHS): ~ 47-49 million VND.

3. Health check (TB Test): ~ 2-3 million VND.

4. Translation, notarization: ~ 3-5 million VND.

5. Criminal record: ~ 300,000 VND.

6. Center and travel fee: ~ 2-5 million VND.

Total: 100-110 million VND (if you do the application yourself).

If you use immigration consulting services

• If you hire a law firm or immigration consulting service, the support fee ranges from 30-70 million VND (depending on the level of support).

• Total cost when using the service: 130-180 million VND.

Important notes:

1. The initial visa is valid for 2.5 years. After that, you need to apply for an extension (FLR-M) with the same cost.

2. The exchange rate of the British pound may change, affecting the actual cost.

3. Visa and IHS insurance fees are non-refundable if the application is rejected, so you need to prepare carefully.""

I've see a bunch of 'how do I get married' posts and felt I should post my experience here in a format that includes the steps required and timings to make things easier for those getting married in Vietnam. 

Before we start however, I do need to say that if you're getting married in Vietnam, ask your fiance (who should still be in Vietnam) to ask their district office (**Bo Phan Tiep Nhan Va Tra Ket Quan ###**) for information on how marriage in the district works. Each one has their own policies and what I'm saying here could be massively off base compared to yours.

Step 1: Have your fiance head to their local official office (People's Committee of Ward) and apply for a 'confirmed single' certificate/sheet/notification. Do this before you arrive (if you're coming in from overseas) as it can take a few days. It shouldn't cost anything to print. 

Step 2: Apply for a CNI **inside** Vietnam at your local Consulate or Embassy. You cannot do it outside of Vietnam as the Department of Foreign Affairs (step 3) will not accept the completed form. In Saigon it will cost around $172 +10% increase per year (dating this thread to 2024). You **need to follow the instructions on the website**, specifically the parts about not signing it unless you are at the consulate in front of the person doing your paperwork. You will need your partner there as the consulate will print off an English and Vietnamese copy to review (no need for a translator). It says to pick it up the next day, but we got it right there and then. They will then tell you to go to the Department of Foreign Affairs to get stamped.

Step 3: Head to the Department of Foreign Affairs to get your CNI's (Viet and English versions) notarised (have a sticker put on the back). If you went to the Consulate, you can just walk here since it's only 850 metres away. We did ours through a translator we met out front who facilitated it for us. No need to wait for the 20+ queue of people. Paid 200k each and we picked it up the next day (you will need to pick it up the next day regardless). Keep in mind it also has weird opening hours with 8-10 morning hours, 1:15-3pm evening hours for submissions. Pickup times start from 3pm onwards. (yes, it's weird). 

Step 2.2: Go to the medical centre/hospital to get your mental health check done. On the same day as the CNI. Before you go, get passport photos taken in 3x4 size with 4 copies each (you will only need 1, but the hospital demands 4 for some reason). Head in (early!), have your ID photocopied (yours and theirs, no idea why, they never used it) fill out the sheets they provide (tick the boxes, list your names and addresses, etc), hand them in (early!), and then make an appointment to talk to a doctor. Pay the fee (400K to pick up next day, or 600k to pick up now or the afternoon depending on how early you submitted it), talk to the doctor (have the same ID you wrote on the application, yours and theirs) and answer basic questions about how you know each other and what you do for a living. Then head out with your papers. If you went in the afternoon, you will have to pick them up the next day! Hence this being step 2.2, since it will take two days time to complete. 

Step 3: Have your passport + visa scanned at a photocopy place. Depending on your district's requirements, you will need to get it notarised!

Step 4: Head to the District's People's Committee called Bo Phan Tiep Nhan Va Tra Ket Quan 8 in District 8 (or at least the sign above the gate says that), and make sure you are in the correct dress code. No long pants for men means no entry. Since I wasn't allowed in (for wearing shorts) fiance went in alone (and was allowed to submit alone). That being said, she did need my passport and visa to submit the paperwork. After it was all submitted, they said to come back in 17 days (due to New Years/Christmas/etc) to pick it up (both of us need to be there to pick up the marriage registration). 

And that's my guide on how to get married in District 8 in Ho Chi Minh City as an Australian! Took 2 days and a lot of running around to get everything done, just need to go back in 17 days to sign the paperwork and we're officially married.",False,False,1.0,"","2024-12-17 14:50:51","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

-Tam Coc (Ninh Binh) for 2D, 1N. I wouldn’t mind another night in Tam Coc.

I’m traveling to Vietnam with my partner, and had the itinerary mapped out. I was most excited about Ha Giang loop, andhad confirmation from Road Kings a few weeks ago that there is availability tour late January and they made no mention of Tet. 

I booked the remaining travel, the tour, sleeper bus to Ninh Binh, accommodations there. Road Kings confirmed the booking then notified me it’s Tet and they are closed. A real bummer as I was so excited about this leg.

I emailed two other tour groups we were looking at, but I assume they’ll be closed as well. The trip is coming up, what does the hive mind suggest we do with our time? We have 2 nights in Hanoi, 4 nights free, a sleeper bus to Ninh Binh from Ha Giang we’ll try to cancel but likely have to eat, and a night in Ninh Binh.

I’m happy to extend Ninh Binh, maybe Hanoi, each another night but we’ll still have a few too many days for both locations IMO!

Super bummed and irritated at Road Kings for not mentioning this when I emailed them a month ago. A month ago we could have made it work, but as of this past week everything is locked in.

EDIT: doing the loop DIY is not an option. I am looking for 2day-4day trips suggestions that are accessible from Hanoi or Ninh Binh

The term Công tử Bạc Liêu (as is the Vietnamese title of “[Once Upon a Time in Indochine](https://asianmoviepulse.com/tag/once-upon-a-time-in-indochine/))  is a colloquial expression from Southern Vietnam, coined in the late 19th to early 20th century, to refer to the wealthy young men—sons of affluent families—living in Bạc Liêu province during the French colonial era in Vietnam. Following the trend of the period, these large landowners and noble elites in the area often sent their sons to study at French schools in Saigon or even abroad in France. However, most of these affluent young men, influenced by the urban prosperity and luxury, with ample money at their disposal, indulged in a lavish and hedonistic lifestyle as a way of asserting their status. The most prominent among the Công tử Bạc Liêu was Trần Trinh Huy (1900–1974), also known as Ba Huy or Hắc Công Tử (“The Black Prince”). He was considered the ultimate playboy in Saigon and Southern Vietnam during the 1930s and 1940s. The movie deals with his story, in a way that resembles a fable. 

As the movie starts the ‘Prince’ has just returned from France with a pilot diploma, something that enrages his father, Ong Linh, who considers his choice idiotic and is not afraid of being rather vocal about it. His sister on the other hand, Co Sau, is smitten with her brother, and always takes his side. As such, it does not come as a surprise when the young man is essentially ostracized to the country to run the family business there, and is followed by his younger sister.

Initially, he decides to take up a bank, the first bank for the Vietnamese and not the French, and soon finds backing by a local mogul, Ba Ho Kim. In his effort to advertise his business, the soon called by everyone Prince spends a lot of money on ‘show’, organizing money burning contests against another local Công tử Bạc Liêu, (in a theme that actually is central to the story and also involves a woman) beauty pageants, boxing fights and more, all of which cost a lot of money, he is inevitably forced to borrow. Gradually more problems arise, while his father also shows up in the area.

[Minh Thang Ly](https://asianmoviepulse.com/tag/minh-thang-ly/) directs a fable essentially, which, as usually in mainstream Vietnamese cinema, begins as a somewhat slapstick comedy, before it becomes more serious and dramatic as time passes. In this case, however, the drama is there from the beginning actually, while the comedy does not exactly cease permanently at any time. As such, and considering the big set pieces, the many different scenes, the star-studded cast, the music and the overall pace, one can easily say that the director’s purpose was to entertain mainstream audiences, something he achieves with flying colors.

The story is not exactly ‘bulletproof” as the focus is actually on the set pieces, but the comments about the spoiled children of rich people experiencing a rather prolonged period of maturation are quite eloquent. The same applies to the difficulties of relationships between sons and demanding fathers, with Minh Thang Ly however, definitely taking the side of the latter, particularly close to the end. And talking about the ending, the finale is somewhat romanticized in the same prism, in a closure that could have been handled with a bit of more oomph.

On the other hand, where the movie truly thrives is in its production values. Duy Ca Chua’s cinematography catches all the different settings through a polished and rather playful approach, intensified by the rather bright colors, which fits, and occasionally dictates the aesthetics of the movie to perfection. The presentation of the era, as mirrored in the cars, costumes, hair and make-up is also impressive, concluding the prowess in the visual aspect. Bui Trung Nghia’s editing results in an expectedly fast tempo, which suits the aesthetics of the movie nicely, while the episodes and the overall story justify the 90 minutes of the movie fully.

[Song Luan](https://asianmoviepulse.com/tag/song-luan/) as the Prince plays the spoiled playboy to perfection, while Thanh Loc plays his always angry father with a very fitting excessiveness, something that actually applies to the majority of the actors. The one who steals the show however, is definitely [Kaity Nguyen](https://asianmoviepulse.com/tag/kaity-nguyen/) as Co Sau, who looks more cute and pretty than ever, in a role that demands from her to be adorable, something she easily achieves.

Although definitely of the eye-candy variety, “Once Upon a Time in Indochine” is a very entertaining film throughout, with the fact that it is unapologetic about its purpose to make people have fun being probably its biggest trait.

I've been following this amazing community for quite some time in the last few months and have been using all the great tips and tricks that people have provided to plan my upcoming trip to Vietnam (Dec 23 - Jan 1)

I have a few questions related to the current weather situation in central Vietnam, specifically Hoi An and Hue.

Attached is an image of the hoi an to hue stretch which shows Thua Thien Hue floods warning. I tried googling it and I can't seem to find much about the severity of it. I can see it's raining now and for the foreseeable future but don't know whether I should change my plans.

My current plan is 
23-28th Dec - Hanoi / ha long/Ninh Binh
28th-30th - Hoi An
30th - take a taxi from Hoi an to Hué and explore Hué
31st - fly to HCMC from Hué
1st - Jan fly out of HCMC

I'm really worried about 2 things- 
1. The drive from Hoi an to Hué may be flooded and not possible/dangerous 
2. Hue and Hoi an may not be possible to explore given the extent of the floods and the incoming rains that are predicted to be even heavier.

Can someone who lives in these areas help me assess this risk and also give me a more accurate understanding of this flood warning.

I have a question regarding driving a small motorcycle in Vietnam (scooter) 50cc or 125cc.

As far as I’m concerned you dont need the motorcycle driving licence for 50cc, but for 125 you have to have.

I come from central Europe and in my country i have driver’s licence category B and it allows me to drive motorcycles up to 125cc, but, of course, it doesnt match with vietnamese law.

My first question is… do you maybe know or have any experience in case something happens (accident), will the private insurance cover the costs? As for the law in my country I obey the law, but as I said, I don’t respect the Vietnamese law.

I know that this question may be general and different insurance companies have different policy, but I’m curious and just want to share the experience.

The second question is about renting a scooter. will renting 125cc scooter be a problem? Or, in case I will get caught by the Police, is there any solution not to get fined?

ive been sort of spiralling my whole teenage and early adult life trying to figure out how to name myself in a way that feels authentic that's also not gonna get me cursed or something. semi believing in feng shui and trying to not be the overly superstitious while being goth is quite the balancing act.

Anyways not the point! ive been living in viet suburbs all my life so as much as i can be in the diaspora (and being most fluent in english..), my main ethnocultural experiences have been vietnamese and id like that to be reflected in my new male name. 

this may come across as morbid and feel free to disregard if you'd like, but if any suggestions could relate to love, angels, funerary art/practices, pathology & anatomy and so, it would be genuinely astounding to me. ive very nearly considered naming myself tử but that's how bad luck comes so.  i will Not do that.

I’m currently dealing with a frustrating situation with Vietnam Customs, and I’m hoping someone here can share their experiences or advice.

I sent a package from the U.S. to Vietnam, and it’s been stuck in customs for 42 days now. The recipient has already submitted the requested documents, including proof of purchase and product names in Vietnamese. Vietnam Customs has confirmed they’re processing it, and I’ve agreed to pay the taxes (about 1.5 million VND), but I’ve noticed some potential issues:

1.	There was an address discrepancy in the delivery address, where the unit number was written as 54J instead of 54G, which I’ve asked them to correct.
2.	I’m worried about how customs handles packages during inspection, especially since some of the items are delicate and irreplaceable (a handwritten love letter, artwork, and a stuffed animal).
3.	One item in the package is chocolate candy that came from a dispensary in the U.S., but it’s not labeled in a way that obviously shows its origin. But the candy does have trace amounts of CBD? I’m now concerned this could cause issues with clearance, even though it wasn’t intended as anything illegal.

Have you ever had packages fail to pass customs in Vietnam? If so, what happens to the items? Are they returned to the sender, confiscated, or disposed of? I’m really worried about the possibility of losing this package, as it has so much sentimental value.

Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone has tips for communicating with customs or ensuring smooth clearance in Vietnam, I’m all ears!

Another thing is I've been looking into a few options to send gifts from US to Vietnam. I've looked at UPS and Fedex, the rates are pretty high as they charge based on weight and international shipping is by nature just very expensive. I saw another Reddit post where people recommended local specialized companies like VietAirCargo. I looked through their website and it seems a bit old (but still very functional), and the way they charge fee is very specific per item. I was overwhelmed by how complicated I imagine the fee charging process would be, because I'd have to report on every single item (for example, it gets very complicated with vitamins).

~~Vietnamese~~  American kids remind me of Monkey from The Planet of the Apes

In any public place, especially on weekends there will loads of kids just running wild, screaming, throwing things etc while the parents either ignore it or sheepishly laugh as if to say ""kids will be kids"". They very rarely scold them and if they do, the kids just ignore it and continue. Where I'm from, kids are taught to be considerate of others. If I even spoke out of turn or asked for something without saying please, my dad would have marched me home to bed without supper so it's quite a culture shock seeing ~~Vietnamese~~  American kids acting feral while the parents do nothing. So far I've seen;

* KIDS STEALING KIA CARS TO GO COMMIT MORE CRIMES
* kids commiting property destruction because a tiktok told them to.
* kids literally grabbing food off my table at a restaurant and running away laughing. Parents were nowhere to be seen.
* kids drawing or scribbling all over the walls
* kids climbing all over things that are specifically labelled ""do not touch""
* kids breaking things that clearly aren't theirs with no accountability
* don't even get me started on classes at school. Even higher schoolers seem to have the maturity level of perhaps middle schoolers elsewhere. Kindergartens and English centres are simply a free for all where the parents can get rid of their little bundles of hell for an hour or 2.

Is this surely going to be chalked up to ""culture""?

1) I'm specifically looking for 100% vietnamese silk custom ao dai. No polyester blend etc. Also, I'm not sure how I would be able to distinguish between Vietnam-made and other origins when I go shopping. Are there reputable shops that we can trust where they source their silk?

2) I prefer the traditional look with the collar, slim long sleeves, and a fitted upper body look. I'm not into the odd puffy shoulders or wide sleeves... or even worse, there are some super 'sexy' ones?  
  
Everything I'm finding through online search feels like fusion ao dai looks, or too multi colored. Is it that hard to find a solid color, brocade/jacquard ao dai with silk made from Vietnam? I've attached some pictures of what I mean.

Thanks, everyone!

If I even spoke out of turn or asked for something without saying please, my dad would have marched me home to bed without supper so it's quite a culture shock seeing Vietnamese kids acting feral while the parents do nothing. So far I've seen;

- kids running around restaurants and cafes screaming while other people are trying to eat and waiters are carrying hot food/drinks. The parents do nothing.
- one kid at an outdoor cafe run into busy traffic while the mom sat on her phone oblivious. When I jumped up to stop the kid from ending up under a car, the mom yelled at me. 
- kids literally grabbing food off my table at a restaurant and running away laughing. Parents were nowhere to be seen. 
- kids drawing or scribbling all over the walls
- kids climbing all over things that are specifically labelled ""do not touch""
- kids breaking things that clearly aren't theirs with no accountability 
- don't even get me started on classes at school. Even higher schoolers seem to have the maturity level of perhaps middle schoolers elsewhere. Kindergartens and English centres are simply a free for all where the parents can get rid of their little bundles of hell for an hour or 2.

I am travelling (backpack, buses and hostels) in South Vietnam since one month and it is time now to head to the North. I have been already to Bao Loc, Da Lat and now Nha Trang. 
During the whole past week, weather has been pretty bad, and I actually fear that it will remain the same for the next 2 month in middle/north VN. 

Since I will be in SE asia for 6 month, I am considering rerouting to Cambodia/Tailand/Laos (which are on my plan after VN anyway) for one month visa each, and then comming back in march to visit north/middle VN, when the weather should be better (a bit hotter, and less rainy). 

So here is the question :
Will it be more confortable to visit these parts of VN in March and April than december/january ?

Can Tuy Hoa, Quy Nhion, Hoi an, Hué and the Ho Chi Minh road by motorbike still be enjoyed if it is raining everyday like past days ? (By enjoying, I mean seing nice landscapes without being wet and cold everyday).

Does it really matter? If you're in the north of Vietnam and go to the south do they change the words they use or will you be understood? 

Does the north and south have 2 different vocabulary/ languages or is it just differences in words use.

One I noticed was the south they would say glass of beer and in the north the say cup.

Little bit of back story, back in April, I sent a package packed with supplements/vitamins back to VN (the usual stuff you see from Costco), about \~$200 worth. Probably around July/Aug my family got a notification that the package unfortunately got flagged at the VN post office, they said it's over the limit, prohibited goods, blah blah... and will be returned back to me. Whatever, no problem, I didn't read the policy so it's on me, I can get my stuff back.

Fast forwards til now Dec, still haven't received it, and yet I started getting more consistent calls since Sep, I usually ignored most since they will leave me a msg if something important and legit. But a few days ago, I picked one up by accident, and this guy on the other line asked for me using my real name saying he's from the ""Embassy of Vietnam"", I got taken back a bit since most of the scam before never knew my name, he asked if I can speak VNmese.... yes I can... and so he went on and on about a package under my name carrying drugs, phones, passports, etc. I committed a serious offence, and I must contact the authority within 24 hours or risk getting blacklisted, deported, put in jail, blah blah blah.., the usual threatening stuff.

Lo and behold, about 5 minutes into the call, I got fed up and I went ballistic on this guy, I insulted him with passion, with every ounce of my being, I squeezed the most insulting Vietnamese words I could think of, not just him but his entire family tree, but I guess his numb dead brain wouldn't feel any bit of remorse.

For context I went with my husband and our 2 toddlers (3 and 1) and we stayed in HCMC, Phu Quoc and Nha Trang.
No one ever tried to scam us, the people were absolutely lovely and so friendly, and sure there's trash around but nowhere near as bad as what we were expecting. Barely saw any trash at all in Phu Quoc and if you want to avoid trash in Nha Trang I'd suggest staying on Hon Tre Island as it was pristine.
I realize these issues exist and that we stayed in pretty coastal, relaxed areas but we were just expecting a lot worse based on what I had read here.

One of our Brazilian vendors recently scammed us. They told us (in person - the CEO and the sales representatives) that they recently opened up a bank account in Vietnam and will be using that for payments moving forward. We have been in contact with this vendor since 2020, and have been consistently buying from them since 2022. This was maybe the 4th or 5th order from them that we have placed.

We paid a 40% down payment (30% is typical in our industry, but because we worked with them so many times we accepted 40%), totaling to USD161,000. They delayed our samples for a few weeks, but we figure they run on South American time and our previous orders they also delayed, but still delivered. We just had a meeting with them 2 days ago to ask about the samples and the anticipated ship date, and they said they don't have a Vietnamese bank, they never heard of this bank, that the invoice we have is fake and they never received any of the emails we sent that they clearly responded to.

I know it's impossible to get money bank via wire transfer, especially for international banking. Is there a way we can find the legal entity that opened a business bank account in Vietnam? We aren't sure if the CEO is in on the scam, or if it was his employees, etc. We've, in a way, given up on getting the money back as legal fees could easily far exceed USD 160K anyway. I just don't know what our options would be if we wanted to find more information on the Vietnamese bank that we sent our down payment for.

From then on, I took that time to travel to neighbouring countries except for during COVID when the borders were closed. My Viet girlfriend at that time hated the Tet formalities so instead opted to travel abroad with me or we would go on staycations in more happening areas within Vietnam during the COVID border closures.

So, in order to get the *same* name for both countries, my son would need to change his British name to match his Vietnamese name since it doesn't look like the Vietnamese authorities would accept his British name for a change of name.

Has anyone had any success at getting a British passport in a different name from their Vietnamese passport?  (Other than just by not telling them about the Vietnamese one ;-/ )

It seems the British should accept that this is one of the exceptions, but they might want a letter saying so from the embassy and I know how reluctant Vietnamese government employees can be to putting their name to any document.

I had an interesting conversation with a Grab driver on my recent trip to Vietnam a few weeks ago about I guess traditions and how society has changed in the country in the last few decades. For context I was born in the early 90s of Vietnamese migrants in Australia. I can speak Vietnamese but not well enough to engage in deeper philosophical conversations about cultural change.

The summary of the conversation is that from my perspective, having gone back to Vietnam regularly to visit my extended family over the my life, I can see how Vietnam's developed economically, but I understand that my observations are very superficial and surface level - I suppose I can see this coming at the expense of traditions and culture?

The Grab Driver really passionately talked about how yes economic change is all well and good but people aren't better and may be worse/less respectful? (my lack of Vietnamese language skills means I only got his tone and overall message and not any nuanced details), that economic change didn't necessarily pull more people into the middle class and that class divides have only increased, and that he would raise his kids with the lens of how he was raised, I guess in terms of traditional Vietnamese values which he saw less of over the years.

What's everyone's opinion on this? I genuinely want to understand this a bit more to understand and connect more with th country - I want to plan to be able to live more in Vietnam in the future.

Yesterday, he became fed up and kept telling me to stay focused and calm while driving. He complained that I’m always nervous behind the wheel. He raised his voice, and when I talked back and stood up for myself, he accused me of swearing at him, insulting him, and being disrespectful.

Whenever he confronts me about my poor results on the driving test, I try to explain myself. I even pointed out that he was angry, but he denied it—even though it was obvious he was. He’s upset about me not passing because he feels the time he spent teaching me was wasted. I don’t understand his behavior. Sometimes, he brings up things from the past and lashes out at me for them.

The only mistakes I made on the test were driving 40 in a 30 zone and hesitating when turning at an intersection. Other than that, I did fine. We still have until August 6, 2026, before my permit expires, so there’s plenty of time for me to improve. I’ll keep trying until I pass the test—simple as that. My dad, however, is by far the most ungrateful and pessimistic person I’ve ever met.

For context, he gets angry almost daily at my autistic twin brother, criticizing him for not being “productive.” My dad always thinks he’s right and refuses to admit when he’s wrong, claiming his anger is always justified. He also believes it’s disrespectful for me to swear at him—even when he’s being rude—because, in Vietnamese culture, adults can swear at kids, but kids aren’t allowed to swear back.

Honestly, my dad is the definition of someone who is both unreasonable and incapable of managing his anger. He’s a big reason why I feel like giving up, but don’t worry—I’m committed to passing the driving test no matter what.

I’ve had moments where I’ve lost my temper and sworn at him because of the way he ruins my mood. For example, he once ruined a trip to the swimming pool by pushing me around. Another time, when I had an off day while driving, he criticized me so much that I started crying. That day, I lost my cool and swore at him in Vietnamese, even though I know it’s unacceptable to swear at adults in our culture. But he pushed me to my breaking point and then acted like he was the victim.

The truth is, most of the problems stem from him. He blames me for everything and accuses me of being lazy or not working hard enough. I’ve explained to him many times that I contribute a lot at home. I bathe my little brother, take out the trash, eat on time, answer phone calls from my parents, and help my grandma with whatever she needs. But he still refuses to see me as a hard worker.

He insists that I need to try harder to get my driver’s license—even though I’m already giving it my all. It feels like no matter how much effort I put in, it’s never enough for him. He’s even said that when he passes away, we’ll be homeless because I’m “lazy.” This is despite the fact that I’m actively working toward getting my license and a job afterward.

It’s frustrating that he has no empathy for my emotions—whether I’m sad or angry. And while Vietnamese family values discourage openly expressing emotions like that, it doesn’t mean I’m wrong for feeling them.

Now normally I’d just assume people were picking up my signaling but the hawkers all over Vietnam are unrelentingly persistent unless I do this one weird thing, that doesn’t work in any other country lol

My wife and I are travelling to Northern Vietnam in February, and we wan to see as much as we can. I've been looking at private tours, but have been unable to find one that suits us since we will be doing Lan Ha bay separately and the one's I've found include Halong Bay. We are willing to do overnight busses/trains, but we've had amazing experiences in the past getting to know tour guides, and as inexpensive as it is for American travelers there we think it'd probably be worth it. Are there guides that would entertain a more bespoke itinerary for such a short trip?

I'm pretty sure we can't or shouldn't try to do it all in such a short time, so what should I cut, or what am I missing that would be better?

Our main interests are:

Núi Mắt Thần/God's Eye
Sa Pa

First time for us both. We are going with only the bare bones of a plan: first couple nights booked in Hanoi, and we fly out of Bangkok (eking out ahead of Tet) so will be working our way south. She's a peace activist and 2025 is the 50th anniversary of the end of the American War there but mostly she just wants to experience the culture. 

I've read a lot (including on here) about what to expect and I have a few remaining questions and I'd love your input on any/all. 

1- Bathrooms! My mom's health is pretty good but she needs frequent rest stops. This sub is full of confusing and conflicting info on how easy (or regrettable) it is to access toilet facilities. If we're mostly on the beaten path, will we be able to stop in easily? Are businesses offended if you ask? Will be be scarred for life and should invest in adult diapers?

2- Hiring private cars vs trains between cities: The cost won't be an issue i don't think, but we'd actually prefer trains for the experience - is first class an available option on most routes? (Not looking for luxury, just a guaranteed seat and hopefully less vile bathrooms.)

3- Approaching older people about their memories of the war: My mom is a writer and experienced interviewer, everyone falls in love with her immediately, and she's been learning Vietnamese with a passion. So she can approach sensitively. But all the Vietnamese people I've talked to say no one thinks or talks about the war anymore. Is this cultural will? Is it super rude to bring up no matter how well it seems the convo is going?

I’ve been traveling for about 4 years now, spending an average of 80 days in each country I visit, so I’d like to think I adapt fairly well to different cultures. Currently, I’m in Phu Quoc from November 16 to February 7, after which I’ll head to Da Nang for a chess tournament before continuing to Bangkok. Just for some context, I recently spent a couple of months in Pattaya, Thailand, which I found to be an incredibly pleasant experience. While I didn’t make lifelong friends, everyone was welcoming and kind, and it was overall a joy to be there.

However, my experience in Phu Quoc has been drastically different, and I’m genuinely confused if I’m misinterpreting something cultural or if I’ve just had bad luck here. It started as soon as I arrived—an immigration officer was yelling at me for a “VIDA,” which I initially didn’t understand as I speak Spanish and “vida” translates to “life.” I realized he was trying to say “visa,” but his aggression made for a very stressful interaction.

I figured things would get better, so I took the time to learn some Vietnamese phrases like “hello” (xin chào) and “goodbye.” But when I said goodbye at a supermarket, I was met with an angry response from the cashier, who said “NO. NO.” quite sharply.

Other interactions that puzzled me included being pushed aside at a water park by a Vietnamese couple trying to skip the line, and a weekly inspection of my Airbnb by the host, who arrives with a rather angry demeanor despite this not being listed in the rental agreement.

These negative encounters have left me feeling regretful about coming to Phu Quoc, and I’ve decided I won’t return here. That said, I don’t want to unfairly judge, and I’m wondering if I’m missing a cultural nuance. Could these behaviors reflect cultural norms, or perhaps an unfamiliarity or discomfort with foreigners?

  
Edit - Unfortunately, it feels as though many responses tend to lean towards smugness and mockery when encountering differing perspectives, which can sometimes make it challenging to foster productive dialogue.

Chào mọi người!

Mình đang tổ chức một buổi tiệc Giáng Sinh cho nhân viên và gia đình của họ, và mình thực sự muốn buổi tiệc này vui vẻ, hòa đồng và ý nghĩa. Một số nhân viên của mình là người Việt Nam, nên mình muốn kết hợp các yếu tố của văn hóa Việt Nam để buổi tiệc trở nên đặc biệt hơn đối với họ.

Mọi người có gợi ý nào về các truyền thống, món ăn, trang trí, hoặc hoạt động nào mà mình có thể thêm vào để tôn vinh văn hóa Việt Nam không? Mình muốn biết về bất cứ điều gì ý nghĩa, mang tính lễ hội, và dễ dàng hòa hợp với một nhóm người có thể không chia sẻ cùng truyền thống.

Ngoài ra, mình cũng muốn có thêm lời khuyên để làm buổi tiệc vui hơn nói chung! Cách yêu thích của mọi người để phá băng, làm mọi người cười, tận hưởng, và có thể cả nhảy múa là gì? Chúng mình sẽ có âm nhạc, một góc chụp ảnh, đồ uống (cả có cồn), và một bữa tiệc potluck, nhưng mình muốn đưa niềm vui lên một tầm cao mới.

Mọi ý tưởng—lớn hay nhỏ—đều rất đáng hoan nghênh! Cảm ơn trước vì những gợi ý của mọi người.

Highlights of my trip include the amazing food everywhere. We started at Hanoi, went to ninh binh, ha long bay, hoi an, da nang, and Ho Chi Minh. We had guided tours of each place except Da nang. We ate 5-6 times a day in order to maximize the food experience and went on 2 guided food tours via motor bike. Almost everything we ate was told to us by locals and were either take out only or curb/street restaurants. I also compiled a list from this subreddit and we ate through 90% of that list too. Overall 10/10 food.

Hoi an was amazing. We were wary about the tourist traps and relentless hustling but actually found it to be super reasonable (maybe it was because we looked Asian?) also everywhere we went in Vietnam some people gave us discounts bc my partner looked like a Vietnamese movie star(?) and wanted photos with him. Not sure about that one…

Ha long bay was beautiful and I’m glad we did the cruise here. Really serene and not too many tourists when we went which we were thankful for.

Ok for the bad. Tbh other than revisiting Hoi an i don’t think we will come back. Hanoi old quarter, where our hotel was, was much too congested, polluted, and filled with scammers. Everyone and their mother tried to scam us. We were physically grabbed into stores. People ripping money from our hands as I was trying to count bills to make a purchase. I literally had to rip my money back multiple times just to count it properly. People trying to give me back 10k instead of 100k. Arguing that I didn’t give them 200k but actually 110k (like what? I gave you one bill lady, how could it have been 110k). I spent the first day just asking locals about prices so I knew how much things were. I was happy to pay double what locals paid but not more than that. People were not happy about that.

We had one restaurant give us an English menu, so i asked for the Vietnamese menu (i saw the table next to ours had lower prices) and the restaurant kicked us out 🤷‍♀️ 

The tour group we were in had a white couple from Vancouver, Canada and he was buying bahn truang Chuoi for 50k (already rip off i know) and he gave her 200k, expecting change. She just gave him 2 more bags and promptly ran away. He was too nice to chase her so he gave the other 2 bags to the tour group. He was depressed about it for the rest of the day. 

Ho Chi Minh was mildly better about the scams tbh, since we stayed away from Ben thanh. We popped our head in for a bit just to check it out and immediately had people trying to sell us those fake LV dog keychains for 2.5 million. they were trying to tell us it was “expensive because it was real LV”. 🤦‍♀️ 
I had one lady scream at me at Saigon square because i was looking at belts and she kept telling me they were real leather and a great price. She took a lighter to it saying “see? Real leather, real leather.” So I brought it up to my nose to smell it (this is how I’ve always been taught to distinguish real from fake leather) and she immediately started screaming in Vietnamese at me. Rips the belt from my hands and starts swinging it around screaming “why you smell? leave! Leave!” I don’t even know man. I can only assume it was fake and she got embarrassed she was caught. 

The kicker was immigration when we were trying to leave. They said we overstayed our visa by 4 hours. I showed them my visa application on my side and it was until December 15. It was Dec 7. They said that the immigration officer wrote on my passport Dec 6. And that “i was breaking Vietnamese law”. They demanded i pay them 150 Canadian dollars in CASH. Cash only. I told them i had VND. Nope. They want CAD and cash only. I didn’t want to argue and miss our plane so I just gave it to them. Then they made us sign three things in Vietnamese. I asked for English copies. Nope. “Just sign”. I don’t know maybe i gave away our first born to them 🤷‍♀️ 

Anyway we were probably upcharged and scammed all over the place unwittingly even though I was really careful. I’ve been all over Asia and have experience with all sorts of scams but it seemed like when you catch them on it they just scream and get violent which is incredibly off putting. I do have to say though, in nicer places like the bel marina resort, or expensive sit down restaurants the service is top notch. I also find that the younger people were all very nice and tried to point us in the right direction and no one tried to scam us.

My issue lies with its Western and colonial origins. No matter how much it’s justified as having been “Vietnamized” by the Vietnamese themselves, its Western and colonial roots remain undeniable.

Regarding the language policies of the revolutionary government before the war, I understand that the decision to promote universal education using Chữ Quốc Ngữ was both necessary and inevitable. However, keeping it as the primary writing system for too long has had negative effects on later generations, as it has contributed to a cultural disconnect between the past and the present.

I don’t support the idea of reintroducing Chữ Hán (Chinese characters) or Chữ Nôm (Vietnam’s ancient script) into widespread use. However, I strongly support a process of developing a new writing system for the Vietnamese people, created by the Vietnamese themselves.

While researching the history of Vietnamese writing systems, I came across Quốc Âm Tân Tự, a script developed by a Vietnamese scholar named Nguyễn in the late 19th century. It’s truly unfortunate that it was merely a personal project. Despite working alone, under the chaotic circumstances of the French colonial era and feudal decline, he was able to create a relatively complete writing system that reflected a strong East Asian aesthetic. That system deserved to be the national script of the Vietnamese people today.

In my view, the lack of an independent and distinct script stems from two factors: the excessive reverence for Chữ Hán and the lack of linguistic independence during Vietnam’s feudal dynasties, and the overly pragmatic language policies of modern Vietnamese governments. As a result, Vietnam lacks a strong cultural export tool like Hangul in Korea or Kana in Japan.

Cũng gần 20 năm mới sắp về VN một lần. Cho hỏi bây giờ ở Sai Gon còn kiểu tiệm net mà có cài sẵn 2 game đó không vậy? Xem trên youtube thấy vẫn có người đăng clip chơi.

Với lại mình về cũng muốn mua sách chữ và truyện tranh đem qua đó đọc chơi. Có ai biết tiệm sách cũ nào lớn ở SG không? Mình không thích và cũng không quen mua online, thích cảm giác đi dạo phố mua đồ giống thời hs hơn.

Thứ ba, mình cũng muốn mua CD nhạc chính gốc nữa, tất cả thể loại, VN, US UK. Ngoài nhà sách ra thì có tiệm băng đĩa nào lớn không?

Rồi khi từ Việt Nam bay sang Canada thì có phải là mình cũng dùng hộ chiếu Việt Nam ở hải quan khi xuất cảnh, rồi sau đó dùng hộ chiếu Canada ở những nơi khác ?

Nếu khi hải quan kiểm tra luôn vé máy bay thì có phải là nếu mình đưa ra vé máy bay + hộ chiếu Canada là được không ?

But most importantly - how do you go from one destination to another? Is my only option a private transfer? I can also go first to Nihn Bihn, back to Hanoi and then transfer to Pu Luong maybe a day later, it just feels like a waste of time..

Any ideas?

OPTION A: 
- Follow the coast all the way to Vung Tau and catch ferry into HCMC.

OPTION B:
- Follow coast to Quy Nhon, then head inland towards Buon Ma Thuot, Gia Nghia, Dong Xoai and enter HCMC from North. 

OPTION C: 
- Follow coast to Nha Trang/Cam Ranh, up to Da Lat for 2 days, Bao Loc, and enter HCMC from east. 

I’m open to either option, I’m sure each would be beautiful but as I’ve never traveled this way I wonder if anyone has any experience with the routes?

——————



I’ve been living in the US for the last 10 years by myself and am married to an American. We recently decided to expand our family. I was talking my dad about it, and then out of nowhere he was like “ If your kids don’t speak Vietnamese, then don’t bring them to Vietnam.” I know he was joking, but it hurt so much to hear.

I live in a city where only 4% of the population is Asian, and I don’t have any family members in the US. More than likely, I’m the only source of Vietnamese language my kids will learn from.

Then he went on to say, “There are so many people born in the US who speak Vietnamese fluently” and then he even brought up some white dudes living in Vietnam who speak Vietnamese perfectly. Gosh, this bothers me.

Those people are immersed in Vietnamese culture and live in Vietnamese communities. They speak, eat, and sleep in Vietnamese.

Meanwhile, I’m over here by myself, with no family, no Vietnamese community, a husband who speaks only English, and a full-time job. I’ll do my best to teach my kids Vietnamese, but just thinking about it stresses me out so much.

Thiughts of our trip so far: Hanoi - loved but very busy and did not feel comfortable riding a scooter. Loved the history available from the war.

HG Loop - perfection. Views were incredible and loved the more authentic feeling.

Sapa - strongly disliked the town, not a fan of anything SunWorld and too many people who don't listen when you say no thankyou when they try to sell you. Absolutely loved staying in the mountains away from the town in an eco homestay.

Ninh Binh - loved! Found it to be very laid back and had a great time ripping around on a motorbike.

Cat Ba - would not go back... again SunWorld. I came to Vietnam to experience Vietnam...

Phong Nha - loved! Limited on variety of food, but loved the oxalis cave tours. Also felt very comfortable, renting and riding a motorbike.

Hue - BEST FOOD SCENE. Loved the imperial city.

Hoi An - love! Great food scene but again more expensive than we're used too. Lots of people selling things but different to Sapa as they listen when you say no thankyou. We are the people to purposely avoid the coconut boats and booked at 4:30am cultural tour where we hand make traditional noodles etc..

Overall, we are the kind of people to purposely avoid the crazy tourist traps, but can appreciate a few of the smaller touristy things. We definitely prefer a more authentic experience in nature and/or getting to talk with local people and experience their day-to-day life..

I have been here since October and am working at a fine little international school (working towards accreditation and fixing some issues in their curriculum now) but it's in Binh Duong which is about an hour from Saigon and makes having a social life a bit difficult, it's isolated out here. I'd like to finish my contract with this school in July and move to Saigon if I can find something closer that isn't totally dysfunctional and pays well (read plenty of horror stories both on Reddit and Glassdoor). I do not want to live in Hanoi. 

I know most of the major ""real"" international schools are wrapping up their hiring by the beginning of next month. I have sent about 10 emails out to schools with my picture, resume and cover letter but only one school has responded (Wellspring) and said they will get back to me when they start their hiring for August, which makes me confused about when the hiring season actually is. It looks like the top schools finish very early and the lower tier school maybe don't start looking until after Tet? 

I have about 4 years of cumulative teaching experience in America and China, however my American teaching license program won't be finished until April and it'll probably take a month or two even after that to have the license in my hand with the FBI checks and everything that must be done. Meaning that I don't think even if I had been able to apply earlier that any of the really good schools would take a look at me.

So, a couple weeks ago, someone posted a clip of a song on Watzatsong that they recorded off of 91 fm in Ha Noi. Here is that post .. 

[Can You Name This Hip-hop, rap Song? I need help identifying the artist, the song title | WatZatSong](https://www.watzatsong.com/en/name-that-tune/853887.html)

That clip is just a few seconds, and he posted a longer minute+ version on YT here: [i need help identifying this song. “What you know” - ???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhYs1ZOdHK0)

I went to the station's website and it seems like they post the shows from previous days with a calendar to choose the broadcast date here .. [Vietnam's No. 1 interactive radio channel](https://vovgiaothong.vn/lich-phat-song-hn/) ... Unfortunately, none of the files for that days shows work, while just a couple for the Ho Chi Minh feed for that day work. I wonder if this is an issue on my end or if the station is just bad at keeping its past shows and broadcasts posted.

The only bit of info I'm missing is what time of day the OP heard and recorded the song, and apparently he can't remember.

So, was wondering if anyone living in the area wouldn't mind emailing them @ [daphuongtienvovgt@gmail.com](mailto:daphuongtienvovgt@gmail.com) to see if anyone there knows the song, or can possibly provide files for the November 9 shows for the Hanoi feed.

2. If someone resets the AirPods, can I still track them in the Find My app?

This year I travelled around SE Asia and, on my way through, was lucky enough to ride the Ha Giang Loop. I told my dad about how good of a time I had, and I’ve convinced him that it’s something he needs to see.

He is flying out to SE Asia on his own for his 55th birthday, and wants to do the Ha Giang Loop. Naturally though, he isn’t too keen on the party/young adult aspect that I enjoyed so much.

Does anyone know of any tour groups, or ways that he can arrange to do the Ha Giang loop with any other people in a similar position to him? He doesn’t want to be alone the whole time, but doesn’t want to be touring with 20 year old partygoers.

Some days, you’ll be lucky enough to see clear skies and breathtaking views, while other days, it’s just mist-thick, rolling clouds that seem to swallow everything. It’s never quite the same, and honestly, it’s a bit of a gamble. 
I’m no fortune teller, after all. One day, you might catch a stunning sea of clouds stretching out before you; the next, you’re surrounded by a soft, misty haze. 
But despite the unpredictable weather, Sapa is still always worth the journey.

From December to January, Sapa puts on a different mantle of magical winter. Cherry blossoms start to bloom, and the soft pink petals come through the mist to create a dreamy scene that changes hourly. One ideal place for photo shooting is O Long Tea Hill, where the blossoms line the path into the tea gardens, making the journey more beautiful.And don't miss the sunset at O Quy Ho Pass, often referred to as the 'gateway to heaven,' where the view will take your breath away.If you’re lucky, it is even possible to witness snowfall in Sapa, turning the town into a picture postcard winter wonderland. The rooftops, trees, and streets will be blanketed with snow, giving the place a look as if it has been plucked from a postcard. 

And, you can also be a part of the local culture, with events such as the Winter Festival, the Red Dao Fire Dance, and vibrant New Year celebrations.

So, whether you decide to go or not is up to you. But if you missed the stunning yellow terrace season in Sapa back in September, don’t hesitate -head straight to Sapa in December.

Quen nhau dc 4 tháng qua thì tụi tui quan hệ có phòng ngừa, nhưng đến 1 ngày cổ kêu là cổ có thai vs tui, cổ kể tự đi mua thuốc tự phá 1m trong tối nay mà k cần tui hỗ trợ. Tui tự thắc mắc làm sao cổ mới 15 tuổi rưỡi mà vừa có thai mà đã dứt khoát kể ra và tui yêu cầu cổ test nhưng cổ dứt khoát từ chối nhiều lần và đòi tự 1m cổ giải quyết nó nhanh trong vòng 4 ngày. chuyện đã xảy ra hồi đầu tháng 4 2023 sau đó cổ cứ lải nhải lấy cái chuyện đó ra mà bắt tui phải bung tiền ra chỉ để mua đồ ăn thuốc bổ và quà cáp cho cô ấy nhiều. 

Và nghe qua thấy cấn ko? sau tgian ấy tui suy nghĩ nhiều lắm. Tui nhớ lại trước khi quen là tui với cổ chỉ là người dưng, gặp nhau chỉ là tui nhờ cổ giúp tui cua 1 cô bạn trong nhóm cổ, còn cổ nhờ tui giúp hàn gắn mqh với nyc. 

Vì tui với nyc cổ chỉ là quen biết nhau chỉ tư cách là bạn của bạn, vì ít nch ít thân nên tui k giúp dc gì nhiều chỉ là cổ nhờ tui chở cổ sang nhà nyc và lúc tâm sự với nhau thì cổ kể rằng cổ với nyc có 1 chuyện không thể nói ra được. 

Vì nhớ ra, nên tui lén khi cổ ngủ tui lén vào điện thoại và bất ngờ tui cũng sốc đến mức đau tim. tui cũng k ngờ từ đó tới giờ tui lại bị đau tim tới mức vậy vì có bị đau tim nhưng k bằng lần này. Thì nyc cổ đó có làm cổ có thai nhưng do nhà làm nhà thuốc nên cho thuốc tự phá lúc này t8 2022, cổ phá thai ngay ngày sinh nhật cổ còn nyc cổ lơ là vô trách nhiệm và ctay lúc t10. Còn cổ gặp tui là lúc t12 2022.

Sau đó tui hỏi vì sao cổ làm như vậy cổ im lặng, tui yêu cầu đòi chia tay nhưng cũng quá là tàn nhẫn khi bỏ rơi 1 cô gái mới bước sang tuổi 15 và trải qua như vậy và gia đình cổ cũng tan vỡ nhiều biến cố. 

Thì tui chấp nhận và quen cho tới hồi t8 2023 là sinh nhật cổ biết nhóm bạn cổ đi chơi có 1 thg đã thích thầm cổ từ lúc trước khi gặp tui và cả hai đều hẹn nhau đợi nhau. sau đó tui biết tui có cấm cổ tiếp xúc với nó cũng lâu nhưng vì chơi chung nhóm nên tới ngày sinh nhật cổ thì tui do dự cho cổ mời th đó tới. Vì tui biết lúc cổ đi chơi riêng nhưng nhóm cổ thì thích cặp otp cổ với nó nên đi chơi toàn xếp cho cổ với th đấy đi chung và cổ có từng kể vs tui là th ấy còn thích cổ cho nên làm vậy xem có động thái bữa party đó ko để tui tò mò lúc k có tui thì thái độ cả 2 ntn.
 
lúc trong tiệc tụi tui hoà đồng lắm, thì th đó mời tui hút pod, tui k biết tui hút luôn và thấy đắng. Dcm lần này nó cho tui hút pod chill nhưng cảm giác nó mạnh dữ lắm hơn cả cần sa tui từng dùng xong tui ngủm củ tỏi trong phòng. Tui ráng gòng và bò ra thì thấy cổ kè vai th đấy :) tui vẫn im ru cho tới khuya hôm ấy lúc tụi nó ngủ lại nhà cổ thì tui dập cổ trong phòng la lớn cho th kia cay. 

Vì lúc ấy đã lên lớp 12, tui k còn tgian nhiều cho cổ, cổ chán cái cổ đi chơi với nhóm bạn đấy nhiều. tui biết kiểu gì cũng có mùi sừng. nên tui add 1 gmail gần giống gmail chính của cổ vào fb, nhằm xoá cái chính ra. đến giữa tháng 10 tụi tui chia tay.

Vừa chia tay xong cổ quen th đấy luôn :) cả hai đi quán cf của bạn tui, nó có radar lại cho tui. Tui cay vừa nhớ lại trc khi chia tay, tui khá tiếc vì tiền vì thời gian tui cho cổ nhiều hơn cả tgian tui học ấy, có nhiều lần cổ kêu tui bỏ học để đi chơi và gần chia tay cãi nhau và tui xin lỗi nhưng cổ đưa ra hình phạt cho tui là tui quì để cổ đấm 50 cái vào mặt ( tui trả dc 5 cái ) tiền bạc tui có 10 tui cũng cho cổ 8 :) tiền sinh hoạt ba mẹ cho cũng 2 triệu à nhưng tui vẫn dẫn cổ đi ăn và quà cáp hay thậm chí mượn tiền tui. Giờ biết sao giờ, tui reset pass fb cổ lúc cổ call níu kéo tui. 

Tui thấy cổ chơi đồ với th kia, đá lưỡi, mà chơi đồ lại bảo k xả đồ nhỉ. Cổ kêu th đó chỉ để thay thế tạm thời, e chưa hôn. lại 1 lần nữa tui phơi bày ra cho tới khi cổ khóc qua nhà tui đợi nhà tui mở cửa để giải thích :)

sau đó cổ đi kể với mng ở quận tui ở là cổ phá thai với tui và nhờ nhóm bạn cổ liên lạc với tui nhằm kêu gọi tui quay về với cổ. Nhóm bạn cổ có liên lạc vs tui nhưng cũng chỉ làm cho có lệ xong tẩy chay cổ nhiều lắm. Và đám đó cũng tẩy chay là cổ phá thai với tui làm nguyên cái quận bạn bè ai cũng coi tui là cái thùng rác vậy á, số ít là chịu lắng nghe tui đính chính còn lại như bọn kids vậy có nói cũng như ko. Sau đó mặt tui như từ chiến trường về, thất thần như Death Staring của Tommy Shelby vậy 🤣

Sau đó đi học tui bị ovtk ae, vì từ nhỏ tới đấy tui có 3 mối tình năm lớp 7 sau đó là tui k có hứng thú với tình yêu cho tới khi gặp cổ á. còn cổ thì qhtd với 4-5 thằng và 1 cái thai hoang tui biết tui vẫn chấp nhận và bị đồn đại là phá thai nữa 😵‍💫 vì đó giờ mng vẫn thấy tui là 1 thg ngày học tối chỉ đá banh cf và là 1 thằng nghiêm túc. 

Chia tay nhau tới tết năm 2024 tui như luỵ vậy, k thể nào quên dc kỉ niệm, cái vô tình tui có chửi lộn vì cổ phá mqh tui vs e kia đang mm. Thế là tụi tui ib nhau chửi nhau và nch lại. Từ từ tụi tui cởi mở như hồi còn quen, tui stop mqh kia vì tui như tìm lại dc sức sống hơn nữa. Thế là tụi tui qhtd và có thai ngay phát đầu tiên luôn và trở về bên nhau luôn. Thai thì vẫn giữ à nha, còn tui sẽ cố gắng xây dựng tổ ấm này nhưng sát thương cổ gây lên thì tui k thể nào phai. 

Vì vậy tui cũng muốn được nghe ace cho lời khuyên nếu tui có khuyết điểm chỗ nào thì chửi tui nghe thoi, và tui cũng mong là chị em đừng tạo sai lầm để người đàn ông tương lai các chị em ôm sầu nha. Tui cũng muốn chia sẻ về chuyện giáo dục giới tính ở các trường nha, vì có những hộ gia đình nhạy cảm nên thường k chia sẻ cho con cái.

I’m travelling to Vietnam at the end of February and trying to finalise my itinerary. I keep revising it as I do more research, but one destination that’s been occupying my thoughts is Sapa.

We’ll be arriving in Hanoi and, after spending two days there, we’re planning a one-night cruise at Ha Long Bay before heading to Sapa for two nights. Sapa looks stunning, and I’d love to include it in our trip. However, the more I read and think about it, the more doubts I have.

Based on my current plan, we’d arrive in Sapa around 3rd March. I understand the main uncertainty is the weather - it can be foggy, rainy, and still quite cold at that time. I’ve also read that the rice terraces won’t be lush and green as they are after the rainy season in September up to November. Although some sources suggest March to May is a great time to visit because everything is in bloom and the rice terraces look good. Can someone please advise? And realistically, how likely is it that we’d get good weather to enjoy the views from Fansipan and do some trekking? 

I have this image in my mind of waking up to breathtaking mountain and valley views, walking through local villages and rice terraces. But I’m worried it could turn into a major disappointment, especially given how much time it takes to get to Sapa and how it would take up 3–4 days of our Vietnam itinerary.

After Sapa, we’re planning to head to Ninh Binh. I’m now 50/50 about whether to remove Sapa from the itinerary and spend more time in central Vietnam instead.

I’d really appreciate any personal experiences or recommendations to help me decide.

Here’s my background:

I was born in Vietnam as an orphan, and I was told that all my biological family died during the war, which led me to end up in an orphanage. When I was 2, a woman adopted me, becoming my mother. At the age of six, she fled the war with me to a foreign country. Unfortunately, in her pursuit of citizenship, she remarried with another man and discarded all my personal identification from Vietnam, also formalizing my parental record to reflect my new parents to secure new citizenship for me.   
  
While I feel anger towards my adopted mother for hiding my true identity, I also appreciate her for giving me a new life abroad. After visiting my adopted family in Vietnam, I felt a strong connection to the country, especially since they shared stories of caring for me before I flee the war. Both my adopted mother and I maintain a deep bond with Vietnam; she even wishes to return there to spend her remaining days.  
  
Currently, I'm facing challenges in proving my Vietnamese identity. My passport states that I was born in Vietnam, but I also have documentation from the country I currently reside in indicating I was born there (not a birth certificate but a formal paper declaring parental relationships). 

Luckily, my mother still have her pre-war ID and speak fluent Vietnamese. Also she has her relatives reside in Vietnam with family book, so I don't have much doubt she will get her Vietnamese Citizenship with those documentations and family connections.  

However, my mother want me to move to Vietnam with her, but I'm unsure how to proceed with applying for Vietnamese citizenship. Should I claim that I was born in Vietnam or simply state that I am the child of a Vietnamese citizen? Additionally, what is the process for applying, who I should I approach to initialize the process and how long it might take? Would having my adopted mother's family as witnesses help in this process? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Also I have concern about the Vietnamese bureaucracy who are petty much corrupted during my previous encounter, am I expected to pay some money to smoothen the process? Especially I feel like I am in a tricky position to obtain Vietnamese citizenship given my current situation. I don't mind to pay some money to expedite the process, all I want to do now is to help my mother fulfill her last wishes. ",False,False,1.0,"","2024-12-06 12:28:28","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

We are already staying in 5star luxury restaurants so that won’t count else I could have surprised with a staycation.
Can anyone recommend any places where I can do something special? Good restaurants probably which are exclusive or anything I could do for her on a private beach like candle light dinner or something.
Please suggest, I want this day to be really special for her.

I figured I could try to make some myself as the most they ever seem to change is altering the audio value, remixing the order a bit, and adding sound effects. 

Does anyone have ideas for vinahouse songs that could sound interesting with a darker or heavier tone.

Canadian here, with a Vietnamese-American spouse. We got married in my country, but I have always felt terrible due to her mother not being able to be present for it.

I absolutely adore my mother in law, who has been more of a mom to me in my lifetime than anyone else, and I feel in a way like I have robbed her of the experience of being here with us in our happiest day. It is a heartbreaking thought, but one that I know can't be fixed with the snap of a finger.

She dreams of retiring and moving back home to Vietnam, and always teases us about coming to visit and stay with her. I have entertained the thought with my spouse about possibility having a traditional wedding back home to renew our vows, so mum can be present, something I believe she would genuinely love. She's a very by the books, old-school traditional lady, and I want to give her something exciting to look forward to.

I was wondering if you lovely folks could share some experiences or knowledge on what it's like. I've always been so fascinated, and really wanted to be more knowledgeable on the culture. Any time she discovers I've learned something new to share with her, she gets really excited.

We think we will be called up to do so at a specific point during the ceremony and that there will be a group photo once we have all done so.

Specifically: Do we file up the aisle 1 or 2 at a time, present the envelope, then stand to one side while the next person/couple comes up? Or do we all go up together, gather around them, and then do the presentation 1-2 at a time (returning to our spots each time)? 

Also, do we stand next to the groom or gather around both the groom and bride? And do we hand the envelope to him, her, or both? Is it OK to hug them after giving the envelope?

The bride seems to want each detail to be just right but hasn’t given us very specific information, and we want to meet her expectations. So while these questions may seem trivial, getting some guidance is very important to us.

I have been in SEA for the past two months: I've heard all about the taxi scams stationed at the airports and such and how to avoid them by only booking grabs. Today I arrived to Hoi An by sleeper bus at 6 am, so I’m quite exhausted and disoriented. When I get off the bus, this guy immediately starts to ask me where I’m going, I tell him I’m not sure and I continue to mind my own business waiting for my bag. He comes back, I say the same thing. I grab my bag and walk away, he then follows me and at this point I’m very tired and he says where are you going, and motions to his bike, I say I’m not getting on your bike I'll only go in a car and he says yes I'm taking you to a small car. So I give in I guess out of exhaustion and reassurance that there is a car and low and behold we never get in another car and I’m on his motorcycle without a helmet and my bags headed towards my destination. I’m not comfortable on these bikes which is why I asked for a car. I ask him are we going to a car he says no. At about 5-10 minutes I told him to let me off near an establishment I see with a security guard. The motorcycle driver asks me for 450 000 vnd, which I know is way too much. I tell him that and he says yes yes just give me what you have.

I tried to put my foot down as much as possible but it is hard to in front of two men (taxi driver and his friend) that are literally grabbing you and following you around. I know that every foreigner is targeted I’m just more annoyed that they would harrass a solo young woman who said no multiple times already, and lie to them (in this case I wanted a car). I’m usually more aware but it's just the concept of wearing someone down that is at a disadvantage (such as just getting of a sleeper bus, is obviously confused) that bothers me. It's not a lot of money at the end of the day. I’m just ranting, most experiences I've had have been pleasant.

1- 2 days in Ninh Binh + 2 days on a Ha Long Bay cruise.  

2- Motorcycle trip to Sapa, stopping in Ta Xua and Mu Cang Chai.

Obviously I have some questions concerning this trip.  
1) As Portuguese, and considering both countries attended Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, should my bike driving license be enough to drive 125cc bike through the loop? My driving license allows me to drive up to 35KWh.   
2) Will I face any issue/ticket/bike confiscated by the police? Which is the correct license to have? International driving license?   
3) How safe is it do it by ourselves? Road wise and anything else.  
4) Do I need to book anything in advance before starting the trip or is it easy to find accomodation along the way?   
5) What is the usual route to take?

7) Network coverage during the trip? Is it good?

A VietJet service bound for Vietnam was forced to return to Melbourne Airport in the early hours of Thursday morning after a sudden drop mid-flight.

According to flight data, VJ82 left Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport for Ho Chi Minh City at about 3am but experienced a sudden drop in altitude as it was nearing the South Australian/Northern Territory border. 

The plane made a U-turn and began to travel back towards Victoria, where it circled just west of Bendigo more than a dozen times.

Flight VJ82 was forced to return to Melbourne Airport after a sudden drop in altitude.

The Airbus A330 eventually landed, touching down again at Melbourne Airport at about 9.30am, more than six hours after it left. 

VietJet's Airbus A330 aircraft can carry up to 377 passengers. 

Melbourne Airport and VietJet have been contacted for comment. ",False,False,0.38,"","2024-12-05 07:29:47","2024-12-05 07:49:15"

I realize this would be at least a two day affair. Does anyone have any tips here? Any contacts or leads for drivers or options?

Our alternate (and more sane) plan is to just skip it all together and fly down to Da Nang and spend our few day trips going to Hoi An and Hue etc. But if there is any reasonable possibility of including the duck stop in our adventures we would love to explore it.

While extremely hectic, I was actually surprised that Saigon feels relatively small in overall size (not including the surrounding sprawl of Binh Duong, Long An, Bien Hoa, Cu Chi, Thu Duc etc). Maybe the relatively flat geography makes it feel even smaller

In pictures, videos and many of our (non-Viet) imaginations, we see the crazy streets and flashy buildings with bright lights and imagine Saigon to be a vast, endless sprawl. And if you include the industrial areas and areas of Binh Duong, Bien Hoa etc, then it is. 

Standing on top of a mid size building in Thao Dien, I could see as far as District 7, Phu Nhuan and Tan Binh. At midnight I rode from Tan Phu to Thao Dien in less than 20 minutes and looking on a map, the city proper only looks about 20km by 20km. 

A lot of mid size US and European cities actually feel bigger than Saigon when it comes to size. Manchester, a relatively large UK city, feels bigger in comparison but has just a fraction of the population (around 500k vs HCM's 9+ million). 
And as foreigners, it feels even smaller as the expat community is so small. It seems like you're always bumping into someone you know, even in expat hubs like Thao Dien or D7.

I went assuming it would feel like Bangkok or Tokyo on sheer scale but actually found it to feel much smaller. For better and for worse.

I just wanted to tell fellow travelers to beware of a tour company called Restours. 

My review of the Bach Ma trip:

The tour is advertised as handicap-friendly and suitable for all ability levels, but this is far from accurate. The description provided does not include any information about elevation, distances, hiking conditions, or difficulty level, which is essential for setting expectations.

I am a plus-sized American who regularly enjoys nature walks and light hikes of 2–4 miles, even with a slightly bad knee. Before booking, I contacted the company twice to confirm the tour would be appropriate for my abilities. I was assured that the tour was easy for everyone. However, this was not the case.

The first stop was at an elevation of 7,000 feet. Although I managed to keep up with the group despite the uphill terrain and slippery conditions due to rain, I fell slightly behind. Based on this, the guide decided I was unfit to continue with the group for the next portion of the hike. The rest of the group was taken to a trail literally named ""The Hard Trail"" by the national park, which required navigating uneven rocks, slippery surfaces, and difficult climbs—all conditions not disclosed in the tour listing.

Instead, I was dropped off alone at a separate trail to hike by myself. This trail was very isolated, rainy, and slippery, with moss-covered terrain and two water crossings. Despite having waterproof hiking boots, my socks still became soaked. The guide instructed me to wait at a waterfall at the end of the trail for the rest of the group, but they never arrived. The few other hikers I encountered were equipped with helmets and trekking poles, neither of which were provided by the tour.

To make matters worse, there was no cell service, no map, and no support. I waited over 30 minutes at the waterfall in the rain before hiking back to the trailhead alone, where I then waited another hour for the group to return. The driver, who did not speak English, refused to contact the guide. This could have been catastrophic if I had been injured, given the isolation and lack of resources.

This tour operator is reckless and unsafe. I strongly recommend avoiding them, especially when there are many safer alternatives available.",False,False,1.0,"","2024-12-04 10:36:34","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

As I flew back, I was wondering why people in Vietnam prefer to try to move to America so bad. I don’t say this to brag but just to provide some context, I make over 7 figures in America and I still struggle with so many things - long work hours, stress, etc.. To bring in the money I do, I work 6 days a week and get to take two or three vacations a year. Almost not worth it.

So for context, me (27F, not Vietnamese) and fwb (27M, Vietnamese) met through online dating app last August 2023 (not in Vietnam) and have been together since then but not in a relationship. Last month, I found out that I’m pregnant. This is a huge surprise as we are very careful with our intimacy.

However, due to some cultural and religious differences, we are unsure of how to proceed. 

Our current options are: (Not in order) 

1. Termination - If we are not going to be together, we will terminate and go on our separate ways. The thing is I am not a pro-abortion and is a Catholic so l could be excommunicated if my family finds out. I'm also already 27 and concerned that it might affect my health too. 

2. Get married - As a Vietnamese he's raised to be very family oriented man so this was his initial option. I know starting a family because of a baby is a very bad idea. He said that he likes me but not enough for a commitment lol. But this totally changed his stance. The thing is I'm also having my reservations for this as he talk/ chat and went on dates with 2 girls while we have an agreement to be exclusive (on his insistence too). Though they didn't f*ck.

3. Single mom route/Co-parenting - Lol. Not the best option either. I am a product of a broken family but my father is totally out of the picture so I don't want my child to experience the same. He doesn't agree with this yet but said be can offer financial assistance.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense I’m too emotional to think rationally. I can't open up to my friends and family so l'm hoping Redditors can give some sound advice. Thank you in advance 🙏

This trip has been on my to-do list for years and years, I just never had the time because you know -  corporate life in the USA.

Fast forward to early 2024, when I decided to retire early and start really living life (on my terms) & now end of Nov 2024 I was on my way to Ha Giang.

1: legality:  even though I have a valid US Car and motorcycle DL and IDP, VN does not accept this as a legal form of driving.   The Ha Giang is notorious for police checkpoints and bribes that many tourists must pay.

When I retired early, I made Bangkok Thailand my home base and quickly and  easily got a Thai Motorcycle and Car DL.   A Thai DL is part of the ASEAN agreement giving you legal rights to drive a car/motorcycle in ASEAN Countries.

I was pulled over / checkpoint once during my trip & showed the police officer my Thai DL and I was passed through with no words exchanged.

The trip:

I flew in from BKK to Hanoi around 6pm and catch a sleeper bus up to Ha Giang around 9pm. I paid around $20 USD for the VIP Cabin bus and it was worth it for the 6 hour drive.  The cabin was really spacious for my 6ft 185 lb frame.

Arrived in Ha Giang around 2am and dropped off in the middle of nowhere, luckily it was only a 5 minute walk to my motorbike rental company, who offers a free dorm room for late arrival.  I was the only one in the dorm this night and managed to get an hour or two of sleep.

Around 7am, I got my bike.  Honda Wave 110cc (around $10 a day with insurance) and I was off for my adventure.

I self guided this trip and did the loop counter clockwise to avoid the large and very large tour groups.

This strategy worked out really well as I didn't encounter mass tourism due to these tours until the last leg of my trip around Heavens gate.  This seems to be the first stop of the tours leaving Ha Giang and many of these first stops would have over 100 plus people at the view points.

The roads were good,  there was one really bad stretch heading from Du Gia to Dong Van.

The weather:  end of November the weather (cold) was a concern going into it.  The first two days of my ride it was cloudy (but views not impacted) and it was really cold on a bike. I had 2 shirts, a hoody, and a sweater jacket and I was shivering at times.    I also had motobike gloved and cotton gloves on at the same time and my fingers were still freezing.    When I got off the bike to relax and chill the weather was very pleasant.     There was only a stretch on day two with about 1 hour of rain (and I pulled over for cover).  With a rain jacket it was just too much because it was too cold to keep driving.

Overall:   I was concerned about it being overhyped, but this trip did not disappoint.   There were many times during my journey I was start screaming out loud while driving because I couldn't believe what I was seeing with my own eyes.    The drive & there views are I guess for a lack of a better word ""magical "".   No photo or YT Vid will give this place justice.

Doing it solo was fun for me.  Sure I missed out on the group connections , or having laughs at group dinners, but being solo I was content.     Many of the tours are catered to people in their 20s, and I can see the appeal.  You get to drink/socializr with other 20 something's and make friends.   If I was in my 20s and not early 40s I would probably due the group tour as well.    

Would I do it again:   yes, absolutely , but next time in the spring / summer to enjoy it a bit more to jump in the waterfalls/rivers.

I would like to talk to the little one in her home language: some words of comfort when she's upset, words of encouragement (Yes! Well done! - that kind of thing), ask if she's hungry or thirsty, tell her my name...simple things that might give her a link to home.

Are children addressed differently in Vietnamese? Do you speak to them as you would an adult? How do I learn this? I rarely see dad as he collects her after my shift is finished and she's there before I start, so I can't ask him.

I do not mean to offend by asking - I just want to go about this the right way. I have tried DuoLingo, but although it's great for discussing passports and other admin.-type things, I think it's beyond her ability to comprehend.

I have a flight with Vietjet from Da Nang to HCM that lands at 9:05pm, I then have an international flight to Australia at 10:40.

I didn’t think much when booking as it was all done on booking.com and I assumed they would’ve taken the self transfer into account.

The booking does have some sort of self transfer guarantee, but I’m sure there’s some terms and conditions that would screw me over.

I’m trying to book an earlier flight to ease my anxiety, but Vietjet won’t change my booking unless I call them with my Australian number, which I can’t use at the moment. 

The booking agency says that Vietjet is not offering any flight changes.

So I think I’m stuck with two options which is to take the risk of a very short layover, or book a few flight altogether.

I might visit the Vietjet office in Da Nang today and see if they might be able to help, but I don’t have high hopes.

After wrapping up my tour, I got back to my hostel around 4 PM, packed up quickly, and planned to grab dinner before checking out for my sleeper bus to Saigon at 8 PM.

Out of nowhere, this Vietnamese girl at the hostel invited me to dinner. I agreed since I was bummed about not meeting anyone to hang out with during my trip. For context, I’m a 32M, and while she wasn’t my type, I thought, “Cool, a new friend to end my trip with!”

We went to a nice restaurant, had some fresh spring rolls, and things seemed fine—until she started acting too excited. She was giddy, taking photos and videos of me, and asking personal questions. I gave vague answers to signal I wasn’t interested.

Then things escalated. At the night market, she got clingy, held my arm like we were a couple, asked for my WhatsApp (thankfully it wasn’t working), but I made the mistake of giving her my Facebook. She even grabbed my leg while driving her scooter, which made me super uncomfortable.

Back at the hostel, it got even weirder. She started crying and laughing when I told her I was talking to someone back home. Then she asked for a kiss, which I declined. She kept switching between crying and laughing, rubbing my shoulders, and said, “You think this is dangerous?” while laughing.

Thankfully, another woman came by and distracted her, giving me a chance to breathe. She eventually left, and I blocked her on Facebook immediately. Hands down the creepiest and most uncomfortable situation I’ve ever been in.

Unfortunately, I understand this is a common issue here... My girlfriend's dad is constantly abusing her mother physically and mentally. He is an alcoholic and uses that as an excuse for his behavior. It's gotten to the point where her mom is scared to be at home and breaking down mentally. Her brother, who also lives there, was also threatened with a knjfe by her dad. They are located in the countryside, which seems like it will be difficult to get some help?

I don't know... I'm at a loss as to what I can do on my end to help. Every time this topic comes up, she seems against everything I say and says that I don't understand, which I do because I also had an abusive father. When this situation first started, I suggested to her that they divorce and get her mom away from him. I told her that because I worried for her safety and happiness. She disagreed and thought they would just deal with it and hope he changes, but months later since things continued to escalate, she says now she understand why I said that. 

But even then, she is still getting upset at me for suggesting to her telling her mom to leave and find a temporary home, since he is now threatening her mom and brother. She got upset and said I don't understand because her mom and brother has no where to go. Even going to a relatives house nearby, she said he would just go over there. She also said the cops wouldn't care. She has been living with me for the past 2 years so isn't at their home to help, but I don't think her being there would help the situation.

I guess in her defense, it's easier said than done right?  But in my view, sitting there and letting him continue to do this won't help. Something has to change. Her mom has broken down mentally and suffered several bruises. I'm worried her life will be in danger.

Halong Bay - 2D1N luxury cruise

Also wanted opinions on travel, I understand Grab is the way to go, but can I rely on it for extremely early morning? Like 6am or so, as I have early morning flights for each destination

Also, Halong Bay to Hanoi Airport, I'd need a private transfe

I’m a foreigner working in Vietnam, and I’m struggling to understand how taxes work here. It feels very complicated, and even after asking around, I keep getting different answers.

Here’s my situation: I have a contract with a company, but they’ve told me that they won’t take responsibility for paying my taxes. I need to handle it myself. Unfortunately, I don’t know where to start.

Some questions I have:
	•	What steps do I need to take to pay my taxes?
	•	Where do I go to register or pay?
	•	How do I calculate my taxes?
	•	Who do I pay, and how do I actually make the payment?
	•	When is the deadline for paying taxes?

If you’re also a foreigner working in Vietnam and have gone through this process, I would really appreciate it if you could explain how it works. If there’s an article, guide, or resource online that helped you, feel free to share it with me.

I have stayed in the US throughout the entire pandemic and my first foreign trip since 2020 was to Europe in May of 2022 and my first time to Vietnam since 2020 was in January 2024 (my most recent prior was July 2019), I don't know what the quarantine camp looks like, but for some Vietnamese international students at MIT, they returned to Vietnam during the pandemic (2020-1) and some of them ended up at the quarantine camp (trai cach ly), and some purportedly transferred to Vietnamese universities due to their visas getting rejected or they were turned away from US customs.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, many people who returned to Vietnam stayed at quarantine camps like what's seen above. I do know of some people and have some high school classmates at a neighbouring Catholic school who went to university in the US for one or two years, went to Vietnam during the pandemic, stayed at the 'trai cach ly', and basically was 'stuck' there as they are now studying at universities in Vietnam instead of returning to the US.

Even though I have never seen posts of my classmates at the quarantine camp since I use social media mostly for personal use and don't follow anybody except for extremely close friends and family on social media, from what I have seen on YouTube, people sleep in hard bunk beds without a mattress, they have no laundry and have to hand wash clothing (many houses in Vietnam don't have laundry by the way), who knows what the Wi-Fi even looks like at quarantine if it is even fast or not, and for some quarantine camp videos, I saw there are razor barbed wire surrounding the quarantine camp (like a prison or correctional facility), so it got me 'comparing' the trai cach ly to a prison because of some of these characteristics. I am not sure if people are handcuffed on the way to the facility but I'd be unsurprised if they were.

I am curious what it was like for you guys to be in the quarantine camp and if it is traumatizing or not, given the fact I didn't go to the quarantine camp, but my sister (who is still an international student as my uncle and aunt didn't adopt her, just like they have to me) did return to Vietnam during the pandemic and did go to the quarantine camp (I don't really talk to her that often, so don't know what trai cach ly looks like).",False,False,0.65,"","2024-12-02 06:26:24","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

But more recently I’ve come across an issue that may be shaving a few cents or bucks off your budget — items being labeled incorrectly. 

A few weeks ago I was shopping at a stationery store and picked out a book that had a price tag that said 250,000. When I got to the register the item scanned and it was actually 395,000. Luckily I was only buying the one thing, otherwise I might not have noticed as the cashier scanned everything while I was getting out my card. I pointed out the price difference but the cashier just said “sorry” so I didn’t buy it. Then, my friend tried to buy a pack of glue 10 sticks that was labeled 70,000. The price of one glue stick is around 10,000. So it makes sense that a multi-pack would cost 70,000. Nope, the cashier said that for 10 glue sticks the cost was 700,000. Apparently the price tag on the fully wrapped ten pack was the price of one glue stick, which doesn’t make any sense. I looked at other stores and on the web, glue sticks cost like 6,000-18,000 VND. 700k for glue is obviously a mistake. Even super glue and or industrial glue is not that expensive. 

Later at a store in Vincom center I asked an employee where to find an item. She showed me and said “yes we have it, it’s 36,000 VND.” I get to the cashier and this time I did pay without looking at the invoice. I was charged 45,000 even though the item labeled on the shelf was 36,000. Again today at Family Mart I got a soda which was labeled 10,000 on the shelf and the cashier asked for 12k. I showed them the price tag on the shelf and they tried explaining something about the difference but I didnt really get it. 

The point is — just because something has a price tag does not mean that you will get that price. You need to check the invoice carefully. Sometimes it’s like $0.08 USD but sometimes the price difference is 5 or even 20 dollars! 

I get that prices change due to inflation, suppliers, etc, and that it would be time consuming to re-label everything. I’m just saying that you should verify the price before paying and if it doesn’t match the tag you should say something. Either they will give you the price difference or they might at least fix it for the next person. 

And for everyone saying “I can’t believe you’re upset about 2000 dong,” I am not upset. I’m just sharing that I have encountered many incorrectly labeled items and that other shoppers should be aware because 2k across several items or 10k on one item might be something like the price of parking. And the price difference of the glue I mentioned is enough to pay for several meals. It’s not a trivial amount. If it happened once I wouldn’t make a post about it. It’s just that it has happened to me frequently in shops in a short space of time, not street vendors or market vendors. ",False,False,1.0,"","2024-12-02 06:21:29","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

A relatively good looking young woman is approaching me on her scooter asking me if I want to come with her for a personal city sightseeing tour. After saying no thanks, and even if I pointed to my wife standing a little away in a shop, she still kept going try to convince me to come with her?! The second time the girl also good looking,sexy dressed, speaking very good English, was even following me around the blocks asking over and over again to come with her on a private tour. I checked on that and found a clip on YouTube where a guy got into the same situation, but after saying no to the girl, a cop just came out of nowhere to ask him strange questions.

I was applying for a visa when I saw a condition about the passport validity after the *departure* date. I sincerely thought it was after the *arrival* date. I planned to leave on 13/01/2025. My passport expires on the 05/07/2025, so 8 days shy of the period.

How strict is this condition? I am leaving in two weeks (13/12/2024). Is there anything I can do aside from a passport renewal which will take way too much time? Did anyone experience something similar?

The Ha Giang Loop with Cheers has been the best travel experience I've ever had in Vietnam. 

My girlfriend and I decided to book the famous Ha Giang Loop with Cheers, and our first impression was great. The staff at Cheers were very nice, friendly, and helpful, especially a Russian guy named Artem, who is both funny and handsome.

When we arrived at their hostel, the staff were ready to assist with everything we needed. Before we took the sleeper bus to Ha Giang, we had a small meeting, which was very helpful. The bus itself was comfortable, making it easy to sleep, and we had a break in the middle of the night, allowing us to use the bathroom and grab some snacks for the rest of the journey.

We reached the Ha Giang hostel around 3:30 AM, checked into our room, and got some extra sleep to prepare for the next day. The first day's breakfast was amazing; it was a buffet with plenty of options. After breakfast, we gathered to meet our driver, who was friendly and spoke a little English. He helped us with our protective gear, and throughout the trip, he drove very safely.

The scenery during the tour was breathtaking. While the food was somewhat repetitive over the three days, it was still enjoyable. Cheers Homestay on the second day was a fantastic place. They had a relaxing area with a view of the stream, and it felt like we were in heaven. The bed was perfect—no complaints at all.

Overall, there are other options for the Ha Giang Loop, but Cheers was the best for us. With a small group of around ten people, they provided the safest, most fun, and extraordinary experience. I highly recommend visiting Cheers when you are in Hanoi!",False,False,0.2,"","2024-12-01 09:52:05","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

I drew a flower and some other painting for her. And ask her how is that, do you like it.

She: I like the pictures and I also like the painter :'>

Me: Sometimes it seems that you say all this just to make me happy. (after overthinking)

SHE: I don't think being part of your joy is a bad thing.

ME: I understand this but my question is how can you like me if you haven't meet me. (Fucking overthinking)

I read somewhere that in such situations a person does not like the other person, he only likes that feeling or appreciation. Then with time when both come a little closer, the feelings of appreciation reduce because then they feel like no need to

SHE: I want to say I like you, like you as a friend, like the way you talk, even though we haven't met yet, you can't say that you're pretending to be nice and polite to me, right? Just because we haven't met doesn't mean we can't trust each other and be friends.

ME: Are we wasting our time in texting with each other like we are in different countries, of different language, different cultures etc.

SHE: Well, I don't think this is a waste. Because when we talk, we also learn more about each other, about the language, customs and country of the other person. So do you think it's a waste? And You mean boyfriend? Well, I said, I don't want to think about that yet, when I have a career then I will think about it.

ME: I am saying that you can make a genuine and good friend in your city/country. Why me, I can't even help you in difficult situation.

SHE: I still have friends who can help me, can hang out with me, can eat with me etc in my country, I want to talk to you simply because I consider you a friend, not just friends have to be together

We decided to stay at a family owned homestay close to a lake, which is surrounded by coffee plantages. They had the best food and fastest internet that we experienced on our travel in Vietnam. In addition to that they provided decent coffee, a yoga platform overseeing the pine forest and even SUPs to enjoy the sundowner on the nearby lake.

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

What advice do you have for us -- either about hidden gems in these cities or practical advice to make our trip as awesome as it can be? I have done a lot of research on this sub and online, so I know some of the most common advice (downloading the Grab app, preparing for air pollution, not wearing a backpack or purse on one shoulder, etc.), but I'd appreciate anything else you can offer.

Through all my trip there I’ve never felt in danger or scammed. I feel much more in danger in my home country.
That said, I was trying to book a Grab, but the app just wouldn’t let me. So this guy with a grab helmet  and jacket showed up and told me he would do the same trip for the same price of the app (25k VND). I didnt perceive danger because of my experience with vietnamese people in the last 10 days there.
1 minute into the trip he starts asking me if I want to buy weed or cocaine, or if I’m interested in prostitutes. I decline as I’m not into any of that anymore, and he starts going on a long speech about how vietnamese girls do it better. I say ok cool drop it. 
I will spare you the rest of the conversation but it was essentially like seeing the little devil speaking on cartoon character’s shoulder trying to convince them to sin.

We arrive and he asks me 25 dollars for the trip. I tell him that the app said 25k VND (1 USD?) and that’s what I’m going to pay. He insists and starts yelling. After 2 minutes of this, I grab him by the head and shirt and tell him to drop it before I fuck him up, at which point he stopped yelling and said 25k was fine. I gave him 30k and told him to go.

Obviously I could only do it because this guy was genuinely as tall as a 12 year old. 
But I think that some people would have paid the 25 USD out of fear. 
Of course it’s not even Grab’s fault and I don’t expect the police to do anything in such a situation, but be careful while travelling! 
I’d say my suggestion is to only take rides with Grab. Unless you’re looking to get scammed. Or to buy drugs.

First thought was it had been stolen by someone. After walking around for a little while, I was told by some guy that the bike had been moved to another location for violating the parking rule of leaving the bike in Old Town after 3 pm or so.

The person who moved the bike asked me to pay 100k VND fine to get it back. I bargained it down to 25k VND and then got the bike back.

I mean there were no any prohibiting signs on the street to not park a bike on the street. 

Considering that incident, I have got a couple of questions. 

Is it generally safe to leave a bike on the street unattended during the day and does it depend on a city/town? How to know whether it is prohibited to park at some location if there are no any signs there?

Thanks. 

P. S.
Yet it's ridiculous how the man (who called himself my ""attendant"") set the price to his liking starting from 100k VND. Apparently, it's lawless and there seems to be no regulation from the police.

My understanding is that Vietnam went to war with Cambodia to stop the Genocide, and I have a few questions.

  
1) Wiki states that the Khmer Rouge was killing Vietnamese residents in border villages, which is why Vietnam got involved. Were these Vietnamese citizens on Vietnam's territory, or people of Vietnamese descent in Cambodia?

  
2) How close are the cultures of Vietnam and the Cambodian and Laotian peoples? Could a Federation be possible? How close are the languages?

  
3) The Khmer Rouge nominally identified itself as Communist/Marxist- was there any political resistance to the Vietnam-Cambodian conflict because of this? 

  
4) When the UN ended the PRK, how was that viewed in Vietnam? Today, what are Cambodian-Vietnamese relations like? Is there a significant amount of trade? Is the UN-installed government viewed as friendly/neutral/adversarial?

I just wanted to share my experience with the Winner X V3 motorbike. If you’re considering buying a motorbike that works well for both navigating crowded city streets and taking on longer trips, I highly recommend it.

Living in Hanoi, I’ve found the Winner X to be incredibly reliable and practical for daily use in heavy traffic. It’s compact enough to maneuver through the city with ease but powerful enough to handle longer journeys. Whether you’re planning a short escape to Ba Vì or a longer road trip to somewhere like Sapa, the Winner X has got you covered.

I even know people who’ve taken this motorbike on epic rides all the way from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City. It’s versatile, durable, and performs well in various conditions.

Another big advantage is its affordability. If you’re buying second-hand, you can find a Winner X V3 for around 25–30 million VND. Compared to other motorbikes in the same category, that’s a great deal for the quality you’re getting.

This post isn’t meant to spark instant conversation or comments (though anyone is welcome to share their thoughts). My goal is to leave this recommendation here for anyone who might come across it while researching motorbikes in the future.

I love my Winner X. After 23,000 kilometers, this bike has given me not just rides but adventures, memories, and countless moments that made me fall even more in love with Vietnam.

If you’re thinking about getting a motorbike for city commuting, road trips, or both, I can’t recommend the Winner X V3 enough.

Hi everyone,  

We’re a family of three (with a 5-year-old) traveling from Europe to Vietnam and Thailand this winter. Our itinerary is mostly set:  

- Vietnam: 2 weeks (Dec 8–21)  
   - 1 week in Da Nang (planning to visit Hoi An and Hue)  
   - 1 week in Hanoi  
- Thailand: 5 weeks  

The issue we’ve encountered is that December weather in Da Nang seems to be quite rainy. We’re considering changing our plans and flying to Phu Quoc instead, but this would cost us an extra €300.  

Would you recommend spending the extra money to enjoy better weather in Phu Quoc, or is Da Nang (and the surrounding area) still worth visiting despite the rain?  

Thank you in advance for your advice!

I’m originally from Western Europe and was a Portuguese resident before moving to Vietnam a few years ago. I now live and work here, have temporary residence, and hold a local bank account.

I was fortunate to get involved in Bitcoin early and have made considerable profits over the years. In Portugal, Bitcoin gains were not taxed, and I had no issues when cashing out. However, now that I’m a resident in Vietnam and with the next big bull run approaching, I plan to take profits sometime in the next six months.

I’m concerned about what might happen if a large amount of money—let’s say around a billion VND—suddenly shows up in my account, which typically holds around 100 million. I’m aware Bitcoin is in a gray area here, both unregulated and somewhat illegal, and I don’t want to risk my account being flagged or closed.

Has anyone here had experience taking large profits from Bitcoin in Vietnam? Would it be wiser to break it into smaller increments to avoid drawing attention? If so, what kind of amounts and timelines would you recommend?

I'm going to Vietnam with my partner in June 2025 and want to decide on an itinerary. I am arriving and leaving from Hanoi and I am staying for 16,5 days.

I plan on doing most of the local trips by plane, except for the ones that aren't possible or aren't worth it via plane (Sa Pa, Halong Bay, Ninh Binh and Hoi An), which I will probably do via the fastest option available (I assume train, including overnight train).

Currently, this is my plan:

\- Hanoi - 2 days

\- Sa Pa - 2 days

\- Halong Bay (Cruise) - 1 day

\- Ninh Binh (considering maybe dropping this) - 1 day

\- Hue - Half a day

\- Da Nang - 1 day and a half 

\- Hoi An - 2 days

\- Beach Location - 4 days

\- Ho Chi Min - 2 days

\- Hanoi - Half a day and flight back to my country



What would you change, namely, add any places, remove any places or simply stay for a shorter/longer period.

Also, as you can see, I wrote "" Beach Location"" because I haven't decided on that part. Since we're going in June, I assume Phu Quoc will not have great weather, so I was thinking about Quy Non or Nha Trang, but I'm 100% open to suggestions.

My friend and I (both M23) landed at Hanoi Airport and after getting a good price for a taxi got in 2AM to go to our destination (30 min away to a hostel). The cab driver drove us around for 15 mins without letting us out and driving down dark alleys near the airport with other taxis hidden in them each time rolling his window down and speaking to them in Vietnamese for a min, they would smile at my friend and I in the back and usually nod “no” and the taxi would keep driving.

We pulled out our own map and kept telling him he’s going the wrong way or that we can get out and take another ride. He kept refusing and saying OK OK. We were getting freaked out so when we saw we were driving through a more “public lit” area, we grabbed our luggage and bags and forced our way out of the cab and had to run to another cab who instantly took us to our destination safely.

Does anyone have a similar experience? I’m confused if he wanted to rob us of our money or luggage why he didn’t do it and what he was driving around talking to other people on the streets for so long.

I found out I was pregnant two weeks ago, and I've been advised by my OB GYN not to travel.

I have been trying to get the hotel to cancel my reservation and get me a free refund, or at least refund with a minimal cancellation fee. But the hotel is not budging, despite my providing them my medical reports.

The max that the hotel can do is apparently change the names on the booking free of cost. It does seem unfair because I called them to cancel one day after the date of free cancellations, but it is what it is.

Would anyone be interested in taking my reservations? Please DM me if you are.

Bản dịch sau đây, nếu bạn cho rằng nó không chính xác, có thể bác bỏ😁

----------------------------------------------------


Nhiều người luôn bàn luận về việc người Việt Nam tập thể chống Trung Quốc, nhưng thực tế đây là điều khó có thể thay đổi.

Công việc của Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam rất khó khăn: từ bỏ hoàn toàn văn hóa Trung Quốc, từ bỏ vị thế “con thứ chính thống” trong vòng văn minh Trung Hoa, hòa nhập hoàn toàn với Đông Nam Á mà họ khinh thường – đây là điều không người Việt Nam nào có thể chấp nhận.

Chống Trung Quốc là để duy trì tính chính thống pháp lý quốc gia. Nếu toàn thể Việt Nam chống Trung Quốc, khi người dân gặp bất công, họ sẽ lên mạng tố cáo danh tính thật; nếu không được thì họ sẽ liên lạc với các nhà báo phương Tây…

Nếu xã hội Việt Nam không chống Trung Quốc như vậy, sau này khi người dân Việt gặp bất công, họ thật sự sẽ “lên Bắc Kinh tố cáo”.

Hiện tại, nếu bạn là Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam, bạn sẽ tuyên truyền quan hệ Trung-Việt thế nào?

Nói là “anh em một nhà”? Nhưng người dân sẵn sàng “lên Bắc Kinh tố cáo”. Hoàn toàn cắt đứt? Vậy bạn không thể giải thích người Việt đến từ đâu, không thể kế thừa lịch sử của người Kinh. Như vậy sẽ làm sụp đổ niềm tự hào dân tộc về lịch sử lâu đời, sự thông minh và văn hóa phồn thịnh của dân tộc Việt Nam.

Giải pháp cuối cùng: Kệ nó đi! Thích làm gì thì làm, cứ để miền Nam chống Trung Quốc, miền Bắc thân Trung Quốc vậy!

Các bạn không thực sự nghĩ rằng, một Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam từng dễ dàng đánh bại chính quyền miền Nam Việt Nam lại không có khả năng kiểm soát miền Nam chứ?

Tâm lý của Giang-Tô, Chiết-Giang, Thượng-Hải thế nào, thì miền Nam Việt Nam cũng như vậy…

Đều là kết quả của việc hai bên lãnh đạo cao cấp thao túng… Các bạn không thực sự nghĩ rằng việc những khu vực này có phần tôn sùng nước ngoài là vấn đề của người dân địa phương chứ?

Vì vậy, càng nghiên cứu về Việt Nam, tôi càng cảm thấy kỳ lạ…

Quả thực là quá giống!

Điều người Việt ghét Trung Quốc:
Hàng ngàn năm lịch sử xâm lược, cái gì cũng nói là Trung Quốc phát minh ra.

Điều người Việt ghét nhất ở Trung Quốc:
Theo đuổi một nửa rồi bỏ dở? Ai hiểu nổi đây, đúng kiểu “trai nhạt nhẽo”!

Toàn bộ người Việt Nam, khi đối diện với Trung Quốc, tâm lý đều vô cùng vặn vẹo.

Một mặt thì ghét đến chết, mặt khác lại yêu đến chết…

Ngay cả những người Việt Nam cứng rắn nhất cũng lén lút xem phim truyền hình, tiểu thuyết và anime Trung Quốc…

Điểm nổi bật chính là sự chia rẽ tâm lý…

Phim Hàn hay thật nhỉ? Nhưng ở Việt Nam, phim nội địa Trung Quốc vẫn “càn quét”, các trang web lớn của Việt Nam, phim Trung Quốc luôn đứng đầu bảng xếp hạng trong thời gian dài…

Hầu như mọi người Việt Nam tôi từng trao đổi đều có tâm lý này…

Sinh ra đã ngưỡng mộ Trung Hoa thượng quốc, nhưng lại xấu hổ không dám thừa nhận. Mỗi lần rầm rộ tuyên truyền văn hóa Việt Nam, lại càng có nhiều người trở thành “fan Trung Quốc”.

Vấn đề cốt lõi của Việt Nam nằm ở đây: từ xưa đến nay đều học Trung Quốc, bắt chước Trung Quốc, thậm chí phần lớn người miền Bắc Việt Nam cũng có chút liên quan đến gene Y của người Hán…

Thực tế, Việt Nam là một quốc gia nhỏ và nghèo, nhưng người dân lại tự nhiên mang lòng kiêu hãnh của dân thiên triều thượng quốc. Vì thế, người Việt xem thường người Đông Nam Á, thậm chí nhiều người còn coi thường cả người da trắng. Trong mắt họ chỉ có bốn quốc gia: Trung, Nhật, Hàn, Triều, và luôn tìm cách so sánh mình với bốn nước này.

Cũng bởi vì từ trong thâm tâm họ vốn khinh thường phương Tây, khinh thường người da trắng, nên người Việt cực kỳ chống lại việc Tây hóa. Vì vậy, người Việt luôn có tinh thần như được “tiêm máu gà”, khát vọng tấn công rất mạnh, ai cũng nhiệt tình bày tỏ lòng yêu nước của mình đối với Việt Nam.

Nhưng điều này lại dẫn đến một vấn đề mới…

Càng coi trọng văn hóa, càng tôn sùng dân tộc Đại Việt, càng phục hưng văn hóa tổ tiên, người Việt càng giống người Trung Quốc… và người trong nước càng ngưỡng mộ Trung Quốc.

Vì vậy, trong “giới cổ phong” của Việt Nam xuất hiện một hiện tượng kỳ lạ: người mặc Hán phục còn nhiều hơn người mặc trang phục truyền thống Việt Nam…

Những blogger ngày ngày bắt chước Hán phục để làm phong trào phục hưng Đại Việt phục, một mặt thì cãi nhau với người Trung Quốc, nói rằng Đại Việt phục không liên quan gì đến Hán phục, nhưng mặt khác lại lén lút mặc Hán phục. Thậm chí từng có chuyện bị đồng đạo phê phán rằng trang phục họ làm ra quá giống Hán phục.

Vì thế, Việt Nam có lẽ là quốc gia và khu vực nhạy cảm nhất thế giới về vấn đề nhận thức danh tính.

Người Đài Loan vẫn có thể nhanh chóng quy phục, lập tức từ “cái bia đỡ đạn của Đông Nam Á” hóa thành “thần dân thiên triều”, chỉ tay bàn luận trên sông lớn…

Nhưng người Việt Nam thì không thể…

Bởi vì, ngoài những mâu thuẫn và tâm lý vặn vẹo đã nói ở trên, người Việt còn có một nút thắt chết người:

Đó chính là, người Việt vô cùng lo sợ bị người Trung Quốc coi thường.

Người Hàn, người Nhật hay người da trắng khinh thường họ, thì họ cũng chỉ làm ầm lên một thời gian rồi thôi. Dù sao người Việt cũng tự biết rằng bản thân cũng khinh thường họ trong thâm tâm.

Nhưng, nếu bị người Trung Quốc khinh thường… thì đó thực sự sẽ là một cú chí mạng, gây tổn thương sâu sắc. Người Việt bị coi thường có khả năng sẽ mang vết thương đó suốt đời.

Đúng vậy, tâm lý của người Việt chính là mâu thuẫn và vặn vẹo như thế…

Họ thích làm bộ hung dữ trước Trung Quốc, muốn thể hiện rằng mình không dễ bị bắt nạt, nhưng lại mê mẩn văn hóa Hán đến cùng cực. Họ tự tin rằng mình là người thông minh nhất, dân tộc ưu tú nhất… nhưng những lời này gần như luôn đi kèm với: “giống người Trung Quốc”, “không thua kém người Trung Quốc”.

Họ vô cùng để ý người Trung Quốc nhìn nhận mình thế nào, không muốn bị người Trung Quốc đồng hóa, không muốn quay lại làm “An Nam” của Trung Quốc… nhưng đồng thời cũng không muốn bị tước mất đũa, trang phục, Nho giáo hay Tết Nguyên đán, càng không muốn thực sự không còn quan hệ gì với Trung Quốc.

Cánh hữu Nhật-Hàn có thể nhảy lên mạng yêu cầu cắt đứt quan hệ với Trung Quốc… nhưng tôi chưa từng thấy phần tử chống Trung Quốc ở Việt Nam nói như vậy.

Ở quá gần Trung Quốc là may mắn của người Việt, nhưng cũng là lời nguyền vĩnh cửu. Tâm lý vặn vẹo này chắc chắn sẽ đi theo người Việt qua từng thế hệ.

Họ từng mơ ước trở thành bá chủ Trung-Nam, nhưng bị Trung Quốc đập một phát về nguyên hình. Vì thế, họ cực kỳ căm ghét Trung Quốc…

Nhưng nếu tuyên bố rằng Việt Nam và Trung Quốc không có quan hệ gì, thì tôi tin rằng rất nhiều người Việt sẽ mất ngủ rất lâu.

Người Việt như thể bị nguyền rủa, quốc gia nhỏ bé, sức lực yếu ớt, nhưng lại có “đầu gối sắt”. Không chịu quỳ xuống là niềm tự hào dân tộc, nhưng cũng là lời nguyền bẩm sinh của họ…

Dù là quốc gia nhỏ, nhưng họ luôn mang tâm thế “chủ nhân”, luôn có ý thức của một công dân đại quốc. Điều này khiến Việt Nam luôn phải chịu đựng nỗi đau không tương xứng giữa lý tưởng và thực tế.

Đối với Việt Nam, giải pháp tối ưu là Trung Quốc và Việt Nam thành lập liên bang, nhưng không được để quốc gia khác tham gia, chỉ có Trung Quốc và Việt Nam. Chỉ có như vậy mới hoàn toàn chữa lành tâm lý phức tạp và vặn vẹo của người Việt khi đối mặt với Trung Quốc.

Nếu có quốc gia khác tham gia, người Việt sẽ cảm thấy thất vọng.

Tôi biết nhiều người sẽ phản đối câu trả lời này, cho rằng người Việt rất chống Trung Quốc…

Thực ra, gặp những người như vậy, bạn không cần tranh cãi với họ. Bạn chỉ cần loại họ ra khỏi vòng văn hóa Trung Hoa, loại họ khỏi ảnh hưởng của Trung Quốc. Bạn chỉ cần nói với họ rằng: Trung Quốc như thế nào không liên quan đến Việt Nam, đừng cố gắng bắt mối quan hệ, đừng quan tâm nữa.

Chỉ cần nói như vậy là đủ, mười người Việt chống Trung Quốc thì tám chín người sẽ mất bình tĩnh.

Điều người Việt mong muốn nhất ở người Trung Quốc không phải là nói rằng Đông Sa thuộc về Việt Nam…

Điều sâu thẳm nhất trong lòng người Việt là được người Trung Quốc nói: Chủ nhân thế giới chỉ có thể là chúng ta và các bạn. Chúng ta mới là anh em ruột thịt. Nhật Bản, Hàn Quốc và Triều Tiên là các nước chư hầu của chúng ta. Chúng ta là hai anh em tạm thời chia nhà, bây giờ tôi đến đón bạn về nhà. Trong nhà có một góc sân riêng dành cho bạn, góc sân này chỉ thuộc về bạn và mang tên bạn.",False,False,0.48,"","2024-11-27 23:31:10","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

I visit Vietnam 3-4 times a year, both on work and vacations.

I am thinking of buying a SIM card on my next trip soon which I could just keep for the long term. My requirements are:

1. I should be eligible to buy it and keep it active for the long run on tourist visas.
2. Should be able to recharge it from outside Vietnam to keep the connection active. Else, I can always ask my contacts in VN to do it from me, but then sending them money from outside the country could be a hassle.
3. Should have international roaming as an option so that I can get OTPs for services like Zalo etc when outside Vietnam.

Finally, I kept cycling and when directly in front of Hang Mua viewpoint ticket office I parked my bike. Then a group of men asked me for money for the parking.

We are a group of young Vietnamese people building a homestay on Ban Sen island (Van Don district, Quang Ninh). It’s a peaceful island, located 15 km from the mainland, with beautiful beaches and forests. There are almost no hotels or restaurants, no tourists—only friendly villagers. If you enjoy simple living, eating homegrown vegetables, fishing and catching seafood, swimming in the sea and streams, harvesting and drinking tea, hiking into the forest to cut bamboo for carpentry, or working on DIY projects with driftwood, bamboo, and pebbles, then you’ll love being here. You can even make YouTube or TikTok videos about remote island life!

We’d love for you to help out in any way that matches your skills, such as making videos or assisting with other projects. The work is not too difficult.

Housing and food are generally provided for FREE (we can discuss or negotiate details if needed).

This week, I’ll be moderating a conference on the Vietnamese legal system. Over the weekend, I reviewed the key points from the panel members, and it’s clear that opinions are divided into two perspectives. One side argues that while there has been some corruption in the past, recent reforms have addressed these issues. The other side believes that the legal system remains insufficiently reformed and continues to be influenced by political power.

The focus of the conference is purely legal, not political. I would greatly appreciate it if you could direct me to articles or resources that provide balanced insights into both perspectives. Additionally, if you know of any cases where the legal system may have been politicized, particularly involving high-profile individuals, please share those as well.

She can stay for up to 3 months at a time before needing to fly back to Vietnam for a month or so, and then fly back.  There has been a recent development whereby my partner is now pregnant - yes, things progressed very quickly!

We are discussing options and planning on getting married before the baby is born mid next year.  Our initial plan was to get married in Vietnam, and also have the baby there.  Eventually, we'll settle in Australia together as a family once the permanent visa is granted after continuing the fly in/fly out situation on her tourist visa.  

As most would be aware, the process to get married in Vietnam for a foreigner is complicated and takes a few weeks.  So I'm wondering whether getting married in Australia is a better option, whether the marriage can be registered in Vietnam, and if that reduces all of the paperwork and time.  Does anyone know?

TL;DR: Avoid “The New Gym” Locations and their misleading “One-Time” Start-up fee policy!


I wanted to share my frustrating experience with The New Gym (particularly their Hoang Van Thu Street location) so others can avoid falling for their shady practices.

Back in April 2024, I signed up for a one-month membership and paid 770,000 VND:
	•	570,000 VND for the membership
	•	200,000 VND for what they called a “one-time start-up fee.”

The fee was supposed to cover account creation, management, and an introduction to the gym. After my membership ended, I didn’t renew immediately. Fast forward to now, I decided to rejoin for another month, only to be told I’d have to pay the start-up fee AGAIN. This time, the fee is between 500,000–900,000 VND, depending on whether I use a promo code!

Apparently, according to the gym, this “one-time” fee applies only if you renew your membership before it expires. If you don’t, they charge you the fee all over again to “reactivate your account.”

What makes this worse is that:
	1.	My account is still active in their system (I can log in via their app).
	2.	I’ve already completed their equipment and rules orientation.
	3.	No other gym I’ve been to in Vietnam (or even abroad) enforces such a ridiculous policy.

This is not just bad practice—it’s misleading and feels like outright price-gouging. If you’re considering joining The New Gym, I recommend staying far away. Their “one-time” fee is a scam, and they’re taking advantage of customers with unclear and exploitative policies.

If you’ve had similar experiences or know of better alternatives, please share them here. Let’s hold these gyms accountable for such shady business practices! I will try to add all 13 The New Gym locations in hope of making people aware of these bad practices, so they can actively avoid ever starting a membership at this hole.

Oh woow, was so surprising that my post attracted a lot of attention. Thank you everyone for all of your feedbacks/perspectives. I appreciate all. I recognized my original post was not elaborative enough on certain things and it might cause some misunderstandings about body positivity or cultural appropriateness, which is understandable. I find many commonalities with a lot of your insights. It is not great to generalize all individuals or criticizing a culture. It is more of an acknowledgment that every culture is not inherently good or bad really. Well but Asian people sometimes...with the fat shaming you know :P  
I do know some acquaintances or friends who end up losing control over their weight but it is because they are diagnosed with certain diseases/sicknesses. I have more sympathy towards them rather than cold and harsh judgments. Willing to give them tips or advice if they are okay with that.   
In the end, it all boils down to individual lifestyles and decisions, so many things actually. But wish everyone well!

We’ve traveled a lot, seen some pretty rough places, but Vietnam takes the cake for being the worst. Hands down.

The Good Stuff:
The natural beauty is amazing. The landscapes? Stunning. Vietnam could’ve been a real gem. The food great.

The Bad Stuff:
Where do we even start? The people. The hygiene. The complete lack of respect for public spaces.

Look, in countries like Cambodia or some poorer parts of Africa, you kind of expect the garbage and bad sanitary conditions because, well, they don’t have the resources. But Vietnam? It feels like people choose to be disgusting.

Spitting everywhere. Literally everywhere.

Driving like it’s a death race.

Zero hygiene. We had to walk barefoot in the airport because they didn’t provide foot covers. Gross.( edit cause is confusing a lot of people; during security. Which is still not ok cause everyone is barefoot plus the guards have shoes which they likely used to go to the toilet etc etc)

And then the kicker: in Hanoi, at the night market, we saw a woman helping her kid take a dump. In the middle of the street. Seriously?!


People just pick their noses, throw trash on the ground, and then use those same hands to touch your money, passport, or you. It’s like hygiene doesn’t exist here.

And the air? We both ended up with skin rashes, probably from how bad the air quality is.

Other places are dirty, but…
 Vietnam doesn’t have that excuse. It’s advanced enough to do better but chooses not to.


Vietnam could be a top travel destination if people just cared a little more about cleanliness and basic decency. But it’s not. And now we get why Vietnam has the lowest tourist return rate.

Conversely, Hoi An may be smaller and have some quieter areas (outside of downtown, beach), but there is a steady stream of tourists in town that makes it feel a bit more like Disneyland versus a place to live. Is this correct?

Importantly, are there areas for kids to play, especially those that may not be in preschool/kindergarten?

- 2D1N: book directly from my Hanoi hostel. My understanding is that the budget options are about 90-130$ and people have mixed reviews for whether they are worth it or not given how crowded and touristy these are

- Day trip directly from Hanoi. This will probably be the cheapest option and will be time efficient while also give the same overall experience. Seen these go around 30-60$ online including transfer from Hanoi I think 

- 2N hostel in Cat Ba Island + Day trip: not sure how great of an idea is but I figured I can travel one day to Cat Ba island and explore, rest, and take a day cruise the next day, and move on to Ninh Bin directly the day after. I’m not fully sure if it’s worth spending 2 days in cat ba but my understanding is that the tours leaving from here are more nicer and less touristy.

Needing some advice on how best to plan out roughly 7ish days in Hanoi/North Vietnam and been having some trouble locking it down. This will be part of a honeymoon trip (just me and my wife) if that changes anything. See below on initial thoughts:

1. Flying into Hanoi on 12/9 around noon. I was thinking explore Hanoi for 3 nights, maybe head out on the 12th or 13th? It depends how much time we would need for Hanoi relative to the rest of the trip.
2. Go to Ninh Binh (stay in Tam Coc and tour Trang An for one of the days) and try to explore this area as much as possible for 2 nights so leave Saturday or Sunday depending on when we left Hanoi.
3. Either visit Sapa (probably would take too much time) or Cat Ba island including checking out Lan Ha Bay (cruise?) instead of ha long bay for another day or 2 and then head back to Hanoi on Monday or Tuesday to fly to our next destination.

Will the above be possible and not feel too rushed and is it smarter to do #3 before #2 or does the above make more sense? I assume we'll have to book a late afternoon or evening flight out of Vietnam on that last day to give us enough time to get back to Hanoi but maybe it won't be that bad and we can fly out around 1-3pm.

Any advice at all on the above or tips in general is much appreciated! We are relatively experienced travelers as in we are used to doing a lot every day but this is both of our first times in Vietnam and trying to plan this one properly has been a bit more stressful than other countries given the transportation haha.

According to their websites:

* **NYC**: They require in-person submission and do not accept mail applications, but I was advised not to come without an appointment. [Viet Nam Passport](https://www.vietnamconsulate-ny.org/service/3/viet-nam-passport.html)
* **DC**: It seems like I can renew by mail, but I’m unsure if this is actually the case or if the website provides full details, especially regarding the fees.

2. Would it be reasonable to just mail my documents to the DC embassy and hope it works?

I am dating a guy in Vietnam and its been going fairly well so far.

He does ask for gifts for when I come back from overseas trips, and when I probe with some questions about what he might like he says, ""You can just give me some money since I can use that."" This time he asked if I can give him a 100 USD bill again since that's what I gave him last time.

I'm from the U.S. and that's not usually a gift we give when dating and I wonder if this is normal in Vietnam.

So far, whenever we go out, he will either not let me pay for what we ordered, or he will order something inexpensive. He's said things like ""We shouldn't go out to nice places so much, we just can eat in or on the street as its cheaper"".

He got into a motorbike accident some months ago and didn't ask for money, and he is going to fly or bus (within Vietnam, he currently lives a few hours away) to see me and hasn't asked for money for that.

He also is very caring and does lots of acts of service for me and has always been very eager to get physical--usually taking the lead on that. (I'm adding this because I think its a factor in weighing why we're dating).

Is giving money normal in relationships here? Thank you so much for any insight.

**Some perhaps relevant information: We are both men, I am older than him.**

So me and my girlfriend are planning to celebrate new year & christmas in Vietnam as she stays in HCMC and I will be visiting her.
I have been almost spent 2-3 months exploring Vietnam however have not really been around these towns/cities. We would like to spend time near beaches(clean ones) and stay in luxury 5 star resorts(private beach) for atleast 8-10 days.
We also have a small dog who is 14 years old soo we cannot really go very far to cities like DaNang hence I chose these 3 cities.
Can anyone recommend if it’s a good decision or not? Because if not, we dont wanna be disappointed and we’d rather spend time chilling & partying in Ho Chi Minh.

A tough choice","Travel/Du lịch",False,9,False,53,"TLDR:3 days: Go to Sapa – scenic rice terraces, culture, and easy access. (You can opt for Ngu Chi Son and O Quy Ho pass if you like untamed sightseeings)
4 days: Go to Ha Giang – rugged adventure, mountain passes, and untouched beauty.

Have you ever stood at a crossroads, unsure which path to take? That’s exactly how I felt when I first had to decide between Sapa and Ha Giang—two stunning destinations in the mountainous north of Vietnam. Each place has its own charm, its own story, and if I could, I’d embrace both in one trip. But, as with most choices in life, you can’t have it all. So, I began my journey of exploration to answer the ultimate question: Sapa or Ha Giang?
Sapa is like a graceful lady who knows how to win over her visitors. For me, it’s the perfect blend of breathtaking natural landscapes, rich cultural experiences, and modern conveniences. The lush green terraced fields of Muong Hoa Valley and the quaint villages like Ta Van and Ta Phin welcome travelers with the warm smiles of the H’mong and Dao people.
What struck me most about Sapa is its balance. In the morning, you can leisurely trek through rice fields. You’re ascending Fansipan Mountain, marveling at the panoramic views of the Hoang Lien Son range. And later, you’re wandering through the vibrant night markets near the Stone Church, soaking up the lively atmosphere.Sapa’s charm lies in its accessibility. The smooth bus or train journey from Hanoi, the modern infrastructure, and the variety of guided tours make it an ideal destination for those seeking a convenient yet fulfilling adventure. It’s a place where you can enjoy nature, culture, and comfort without too much effort. But if you're still seeking something wild and untamed, Ngu Chi Son and O Quy Ho Pass are where your heart will belong.
If Sapa is a graceful lady, then Ha Giang is a wild, rugged warrior. It’s not a destination for the faint-hearted, but for those who crave adventure and authenticity, Ha Giang offers an unparalleled experience.Driving along the Ha Giang Loop, I was captivated by the dramatic limestone peaks, winding roads, and deep valleys. Iconic stops like Ma Pi Leng Pass, Dong Van Plateau, Tay Con Linh Mount and the emerald Nho Que River were nothing short of awe-inspiring. The boat ride on the Nho Que River, surrounded by towering cliffs, felt like stepping into a dream.
What sets Ha Giang apart is its unspoiled nature and cultural richness. Remote villages, like Lung Tam and Dong Van, let you glimpse into the lives of ethnic groups who have preserved their traditions for generations. Sitting around a campfire with locals, sipping corn wine, and listening to their stories under a star-studded sky. These are the moments that make Ha Giang unforgettable.However, Ha Giang demands effort. The journey there, whether by motorbike or overnight bus, is challenging. The roads are rugged, the terrain unforgiving, but the rewards? Absolutely worth it.
So, which destination is for you?
Sapa is perfect for those seeking a mix of beauty, culture, and comfort. It’s where you can enjoy trekking, delicious food, and vibrant markets without straying too far from modern conveniences. Meanwhile, Ha Giang calls to the adventurer in your heart - the one who dreams of winding mountain roads, untouched landscapes, and deep cultural connections.
If you want an easy yet enriching trip, Sapa is your destination. But if you’re willing to step out of your comfort zone for raw, untamed beauty, Ha Giang is the place to go. Personally, I couldn’t choose just one. Each destination touched my heart in different ways, and if given the chance, I’d revisit both in a heartbeat.",False,False,0.97,"","2024-11-22 08:24:35","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

The package contains a birthday gift which is just a photo album with personal photo's in it, it has no monetary value and contains nothing else.

At first I received a e-mail informing me that it was not possible to import ""used goods"" into Vietnam, so they would return it to me. After I explained to them what was inside the package they told me they'd resolve the clearance for me. 

Then I receive another e-mail asking for photo's and a description of the product inside, which I luckily had so I sent it to them, again they told me they would clear the package.

Two days later I receive another e-mail informing me that the package is now on hold because it needs a ""import license and/or cultural examination results"", whatever the hell that even means. They said DHL VN will work on getting these documents which can take 7-9 working days, and I'll have to pay a fee of up to 55k vnd per day for storage of the package.

Am I taking crazy pills or does this all seem extremely excessive for sending a photo album with personal photo's as a gift...?

The fee is not even a big deal to me, I just hope they will charge me online and don't try to make the recipient pay for it on arrival...

Both subreddits have a strong convergence with news/geopolitics/meme spamming/etc subreddits. 

Just wondering why this subreddit sees a similar trend, especially as the majority here are not Vietnamese since it's not a popular site in Vietnam. A few years back most posters were diaspora/expats/tourists, and was more on point with the country, but I am starting to see alot of disinfo getting pedaled here now.

Spoiler: It was absolutely AMAZING, and I’m so glad we did it on our own instead of joining one of the hostel tours.

Our Setup

We rented motorbikes from a small, lovely shop for four days. The owner was incredibly helpful, providing us with a map that included not only all the must-see spots but also hidden gems and tips.

Our Route:

Day 1: Ha Giang → Dong Van

Day 2: Exploring the Dong Van area

Day 3: Dong Van → Du Gia

Day 4: Du Gia → Ha Giang


We didn’t have international driving licenses and, as expected, got stopped by the police. We paid a 50$ ""fine"" (which we knew about beforehand) and were left to ride without issues for the rest of the trip. Honestly, I think 50$ for four days of riding freely is a great deal.

Why Solo Is Better

Flexibility: We went at our own pace, stopped wherever we wanted, and didn’t feel rushed. For example, instead of staying at crowded viewpoints where huge hostel groups gathered, we’d drive just a bit further and find equally or more stunning, quiet spots.

Accommodation: We could choose our own homestays and hotels, which were fantastic compared to the basic ones hostel groups often book.

Unique Experiences: Meeting locals and other travelers in smaller homestays gave us a much more personal experience.

Freedom: When a big hostel with 30-40 motorbikes overtook us, it just reinforced how much better it was to explore at our own pace.
Im sure for many people this is fun but for me this just looked like hell. 

Safety

The first hours on the bike were intimidating—busy roads, unfamiliar terrain—but if you’ve ridden a scooter before, you’ll adjust quickly. Take it slow, and you’ll be fine.

For Those Unsure

If you don’t feel confident enough riding a motorbike, consider a private tour with a small group (max 4-5 people). But for anyone with basic scooter experience, doing it solo is a 10/10 experience.

Final Thoughts

Don’t hesitate to do the Ha Giang Loop on your own! It was one of the best travel experiences of my life, and the freedom and flexibility make it unforgettable.

Happy riding!

Here’s the situation:

1. The document says I was driving at **73 km/h** but does not mention the speed limit of the road where this happened. I recall it being a **60 km/h zone**, meaning I was over by 13 km/h.
2. The car rental company claims there’s a **5 million VND fine** and a **2-month license suspension**, but they have not provided any official documentation to confirm this apart from informal text messages.
   * The **official document I received only mentions the speeding violation** and has no details about a penalty, fine, or license suspension.
   * The document shows the violation occurred on **October 3, 2024**, and it states the issue needed to be resolved by **October 20, 2024**. It is now **November 20, 2024**, and I’m confused as to why they are only bringing this up now.
3. I thought the **car rental company**, as the vehicle owner, would handle matters with the police directly. However, they’re telling me **I need to take the document to the police station myself**.
   * Is this normal, or are they trying to shift responsibility onto me?
4. They also mentioned something unusual about ""renting a license"" to pay the fine because they claim my license needs to be **suspended for 2 months**.
   * This doesn’t sound legitimate—has anyone heard of this?

They are insisting I visit the police station with the document and my license to resolve this matter.

# My Questions:

* Is it normal in Vietnam for car rental companies to require the renter to resolve traffic fines themselves, especially when the vehicle is registered under the rental company?
* Shouldn’t the car rental company handle this directly with the police, given they’re the registered owner?
* Should I insist on **official proof** (e.g., a police fine notice or invoice) before taking any action?
* How are speeding fines for violations like this (73 km/h in a 60 km/h zone) usually resolved in Vietnam?
* My drivers license is from outside (Jordan), I rented this car as a foreigner and the car company only asked if i have a drviers license in general. 

I’d appreciate any advice or insights from people familiar with Vietnamese traffic laws or similar situations. Thanks in advance for your help!",False,False,0.5,"","2024-11-20 08:25:11","2024-11-20 08:28:20"

This is for all the people who want to go on a little adventure on their own without taking to many risks in the region. It is dave and fun to visit if you want a little off track cave exploration. 

I was around the dark cave and saw on Google maps that there was a ‘wine cave’ around, so I was pretty interested to find it. 

The track starts at a graveyard and continues over the field. I had to cross two small rivers (knee deep) to get there. You will see the cave when you cross. It is a nice crack in the rock. 

Apparently wine was stored there back in the days for fermentation. There a poles to get up, but I didn’t do it. 

I went to drink a tea with a local on the small café in the street there (floating house) and he told me (with translate) something about monkeys being there and drinking alcohol.  Maybe we were a bit lost in translation.

Obviously I travel to vietnam quite a bit with work, so understanding a bit of the language I think is just polite.

My brain is logical so it tries to identify patterns in the language but using the below example makes no sense to me:

mặt on its own means “face”
And trời on its own means “God”
Therefore my brain goes - ok so mặt trời therefore means “face god”
Actually it means “Sun” ☀️

Between Ninh Binh and Ho Chi Minh we can't really make up our minds on where to go.

Our initial plan was to check out Da Nang, Hue or Hoi An for 3 days before going down to Ho Chi Minh, but after some research I am not sure any more. Hoi An seems to become a tourist trap according to many of you here.

Is it better to go to Hue or Da Nang? Or should we just do something else? Check out some Island or head down south earlier?

We are in our 30s and like nature adventure, food and party. We do not need fancy hotels or something like that, but just cool experiences. Both of us have backpacked in our 20s in Asia and Middle East so we do like backpacker vibe and places.

When she came to Australia she spoke zero English but in 3-4 months was fluent, and after a year her English sounded 'native' with no real accent. Actually just a very slight international school english accent (like a neutral american accent?). She now goes to senior school here in English, her friends speak English, and she is plannning on going to one of the top tier universities here (in English, obviously).

So here is the issue. Her mum (my partner) speaks multiple languages and tries to maintain speaking VN at home with her daughter, but her general level of VN language is 'stuck' at the level she was a a 10 year old. Or maybe worse - she is worried that she is slowly losing what VN language she had. She is worried that after 1 more year of school and 4 years of uni she might not really have much VN left at all.

She is keen to keep her VN language and to bring it up to her age level as after uni she is keen to look for opportunities in both Aus (or other English language countries) or VN. She is a dual citizen (by passport) but she wants to be a dual citizen by language/culture also. But speaking daily with her mum and then 3-4 weeks in VN for tet each year just is obviously not sufficient.

So those of you who have been in this sitaution, what advice do you have? Chatting online? Duolingo? Just leave it until after uni and then go and work in VN for a year and have a steep learning curve?

Please note: anything I ask her about regarding the topics below, she denies, even though I can sense she’s lying. I feel so sad for the baby—such an innocent soul mighy have to suffer because of her mom. It’s heartbreaking.

I’m 10 years older than my girlfriend, and we met while I was traveling in Vietnam. She’s Vietnamese, and things moved quickly between us. Five months into our relationship, she got pregnant. I wasn’t ready for it, but she said she would keep the baby, with or without me. I ended up covering all the pregnancy and delivery expenses.

From August 2023 to July 2024, I was paying her rent and giving her around 15 million VND in pocket money. After she moved to her mom's place (end of June 2024) to give birth, I continued sending her the same amount.

The real issue for me is trust. I’ve learned that she wasn’t honest about her past. From 16 to 18, she had 6 boyfriends and some FWBs, which shows she has a high libido. She’s lied to me about so many things, and it’s left me feeling uneasy.

She also has a habit of indirectly asking for more money. When I ask where she’s spending it, she’ll sometimes make me count the same amounts twice. The money she spends in Vietnam is more than some people’s monthly salary, and she finishes it in a week or 10 days. It just doesn’t add up.

Recently, her ex-cousin sister added me on Instagram and told me that the reasons my girlfriend gave me for breaking up with her brother were lies. She shared that my girlfriend went to a bar with her ex, got drunk, and then left him to dance with and kiss another girl, like full tongue-to-tongue. She also lied about being financially independent, saying her parents didn’t support her, which was untrue. She told me the same thing. There were also claims about her making 40-50 million VND in high school but leaving that job to move to Ho Chi Minh City to study, which turned out to be a lie. She even claimed she gave her parents 400-500 million VND to buy a car, which was also a lie.

Her ex later contacted me and confirmed everything her cousin said was true. He also shared that while she was dating me, she was still in a relationship with him. The night before she came to my hotel, they met, kissed, and agreed to try to make their relationship work. They even talked about marriage. But after coming to my hotel, she broke up with him. She then lied, saying nothing happened between us, which wasn’t true.

Another thing her ex told me was that she would give flying kisses to passing foreigners in bars while she was with him. And the kicker—I'm also a foreigner. It feels like there’s a pattern of behavior that I can’t ignore.

In addition, her ex revealed that she had told him she was on contraceptive pills and that he could finish inside her, which he never did. She told him she will enjoy it more if he did. She said the same thing to me, and I believed she was on birth control—until she got pregnant.

There are so many lies and manipulations, and while I haven’t seen her do these things recently, I’m still struggling with the fact that she lied about her past and continues to manipulate me. Sometimes I think about marrying her and seeing how things go, but then I wonder if she’s still lying, hiding things, and manipulating me. What if she’s still doing the same things? What if she goes back to sleeping around because that’s what she enjoyed, and she has a high libido?

Her ex and his cousin (who is also her high school friend) told me that if I looked around her room, I’d find manipulation books, which I ended up finding to be true.

What do you guys think? Is she just waiting for the right time to go back to her old ways, or has she really changed? How can someone change in just a few months? She broke up with her ex and met me in July 2023, so it feels like a lot of these patterns could still be there. I’m really torn and would appreciate any insight.",False,False,0.83,"","2024-11-19 11:03:37","2024-11-19 11:50:31"

I know absolutely nothing about Vietnamese culture. I need help. He has been telling me things in the past several months about how his parents probably won’t like me. I’m a hard worker but I don’t have a college degree because I was never a school person but I am pretty proud of myself with a secure job where I’m financially content in the moment. Ive been on a weight loss journey since before we met and have lost 70 lbs in the past two years. Overall I’m typically a very confident outspoken woman and am proud of myself and where I’m currently at in life.

But I can’t seem to shake this nervousness and self doubt that has started to creep in since I realized I would actually be meeting them just next week. Like I’m uneducated, overweight, and white so what can I even offer their son. 

I have no idea what to wear or how to act. Should I be the vocal opinionated woman I am but not too much or should I be way more reserved than I am and only speak when asked a question? I just don’t want to be rude and want to be respectful of the Vietnamese culture. I don’t know how to speak Vietnamese. I barely can use chopsticks. 

I was planning to bring his mom flowers, what type should I bring? Or would a plant be better? I was going to bake a desert for his dad (anytime he goes to see them he brings a sweet that I made during the week because his dad loves sweets) Any suggestions? And then maybe fresh fruit for everyone or is that not a good idea?

Should I try to quickly learn a little bit of Vietnamese? I’m not good learning other languages so if I accidentally butcher the language would that be rude? Will they appreciate that I tried or no? 

The way he makes things sound is that no matter what he does they’ll never be happy so now I’m just stuck over thinking EVERYTHING. I am beyond in love with their son so I hope they can see that and at least learn to love me eventually. I would hate for this first meeting to be a bad impression.

I moved to Vietnam with the intention of staying here. The first two weeks were great. I'm met dozens of interesting people. I'm absolutely loving it. 

 Unfortunately I started developing pains in my chest. Within a few days, my legs felt cramped and sore. I diagnosed myself with deep vein thrombosis, or blood clots in the leg. This is most likely from the 18-hour plane ride and my lack of movement. 

I went to the ER. I had prepared a translation of my timeline of symptoms and self-diagnosis. The doctor agreed with my conclusion and I was quickly given ultrasound to check the veins of my leg and a blood test called d-dimer which checks for clotting agents. 

A normal d-dimer is under 500. Mine was 10,000. In addition,  blood clots in your leg can travel to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. So they were extremely concerned about the pain I had when breathing. A pulmonary embolism is life-threatening. Basically a heart attack in your lungs. 

They gave me an x-ray and identified that the lung pain was actually pneumonia. After treating me daily with blood thinners and intravenous antibiotics, I showed improvement and they said I would be discharged. 

I had a private room for 4 days. It cost $35 million vnd. I know this is a high price for Vietnam but it's a low price for life-saving care in the United States and the high level of attention I received. 

Unfortunately recovery is slow. I'll be on blood thinners for at least 3 months. I'm a bit discouraged and bored because I can't walk very well. But I'm lucky to have met some people who are looking out for me. 

I don't have a point or an agenda! I'm on bed rest and I can't do much. I wanted to share my story and see if it resonated. Take care of yourself. ",False,False,0.99,"","2024-11-18 14:30:21","1970-01-01 00:00:00"

Here are some essential tips to help you make the most of your Ha Giang trip: 

1. September to December is prime time for golden rice terraces and buckwheat flowers. But temperatures drop significantly at night, especially in Dong Van and Meo Vac, so pack layers and a warm jacket.

2. Gas stations can be scarce, particularly in remote areas like Meo Vac and Du Gia. Always top up in larger towns like Yen Minh or Dong Van, even if your tank isn't empty.3. Many riders stick to the classic loop, but exploring hidden gems like Nai Waterfall near Quan Ba or the ""White Cliff"" (God's Cliff) on Ma Pi Leng Pass offers less crowded, equally stunning experiences.4. I also met a lot of visitors rush through Ma Pi Leng Pass without realizing you can descend and take a boat ride along the Tu San Gorge. It's a completely different perspective on Ha Giang's dramatic landscapes.5. If you're unsure about riding a motorbike in the mountains, consider booking a local guide or ""easy rider."" They’ll not only ensure your safety but also share cultural insights and take you off the beaten path.6. Don’t sleep on the weekend markets in Dong Van or Meo Vac. It's a chance to interact with locals and see the incredible variety of handmade goods and fresh produce.7. While ""thang co"" and ""men men"" are famous, make sure to taste Ha Giang's fresh mountain vegetables, artisan pho in Trang Kim, and a bowl of au tau porridge- perfect after a long, chilly ride.
8. Don't rush the loop in 3 days—it’s exhausting and you'll miss out on the slower, magical moments. Take 4–5 days to truly soak in the beauty and culture of Ha Giang.9. Remember, the real gems of the Ha Giang Loop are in the quiet moments: a sunset at Ma Pi Leng, a heartfelt chat with a homestay host, or the serenity of the Nho Que River.

So there isn't any type of ""I'm using you to get a green card type of deal"" just want to know how you're life back in the States or outside of Vietnam is, how do you make it work/adjust their life? 


Edit 2: thanks for all the responses so far. So yes for me it's mindset of why I prefer someone overseas than in the States. No I'm not ugly, and I do have a good personality, just haven't aligned with anyone here, but I'm not going to Vietnam to look for someone, I'm in the States and have a family friend that have already introduced me to someone(their family) back in Vietnam. We've been talking for a few weeks. The family friend that introduced me is wealthy. It's definitely not about getting a green card, I just want to see if taking them away from Vietnam if they'll be able to live a life in the states. They didn't want to leave Vietnam before but is now open to the idea.

It was hands down my favorite part of traveling through Vietnam. If you’re considering doing the loop soon, I’d like to share some recommendations for choosing between different tour options.

Each tour company comes with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Large companies like Jasmine Tours tend to be significantly more expensive and often have enormous groups of 20+ people. I’d advise against booking with these big companies for a few reasons: it’s challenging to get good photos when you’re part of a massive group, the dust from other bikes on the road can be overwhelming (especially if you’re riding behind someone), and there are only a handful of English-speaking guides who are often spread too thin among the tourists. Additionally, these companies typically offer accommodations that cater to a party atmosphere, so if you’re not into loud music and festivities that go on past midnight, this might not be for you.

On the other hand, we heard far better reviews from  travelers who booked with smaller companies that limit their tours to groups of 6-8 people. These smaller tours offered a more personal and enjoyable experience.

My partner and I took a different approach: we hired an easy rider privately. These freelance riders often work for various companies but usually earn only a small portion of what tourists pay. We found our local rider through our hotel, and he offered us a private tour for a much lower cost while still booking the same high-quality accommodations and meals that the larger companies use. This way, we not only saved money but also ensured our rider was paid more fairly than if we had gone through a company.

Because we’re not big on partying, our rider arranged for us to stay in air-conditioned hotels away from the noisy hostels, so we enjoyed peaceful nights and were well-rested each day. He also tailored the itinerary to our preferences, making the experience feel personal and unique.

 Having our own rider meant we could set off early each morning, avoiding the crowds and enjoying a more relaxed ride. If you do end up behind a lot of bikes, wearing a face mask is useful to help with dust and allergies.

For anyone interested in hiring an easy rider, I highly recommend our guide, Lee. He spoke excellent English, was incredibly friendly, and took us to hidden spots along the loop . He genuinely cared about making our trip memorable and customized the tour to ensure we had a fantastic time.

In short, hiring an easy rider privately is a great way to experience the loop whilst supporting the rider directly. If you do go through a company, opt for a small group tour and make sure to tip your rider.

I am hoping to move to Vietnam with my son. I am originally from America, but have always had a passion for travel and have heard (even through research) that Vietnam is a beautiful place for expats, and for children. From the sounds of it, much warmer in nature than where I have been in the US. 

My question is, how do I find a job as an English speaker to make this dream possible and how do I find childcare or, alternatively, enroll my son into an elementary school. We are both working on our Vietnamese but I do need to put much more time/effort in this endeavor before I am fluent. I have heard that this isn’t a huge problem, outside of scams and market issues. 

For reference, I am a woman in my 30s with no relations in Vietnam. However, it isn’t unusual for me to live somewhere without direct connections. This will be my first time doing so internationally, and I want to be sure we are safe.

Another affordable option is **Mui Ne**, a small town known for its scenic beaches and sand dunes. While it is more popular with tourists, it still offers reasonable living costs, particularly for renting and groceries. The town is well-connected to major cities, making it convenient for travel.

For a blend of affordability and rich cultural heritage, **Hoi An** is another excellent option. While slightly more touristy, its proximity to beaches like An Bang and its vibrant local markets provide a unique lifestyle at a reasonable cost.

If you're not getting the hint already from the video, Feli From Germany is a Youtuber currently living in America of German citizenry who makes Youtube content about life in Germany and often compares it to life in the USA. She touches various different stuff from daily cultural norms to intro stuff about the big companies and businesses of Germany and so much more. Every other week she'll post a video about the German languages and its basic rules like how to pronounce words correctly and pointing out how Americans get it wrong, basic conjugation rules, etc nothing too complicated but enough for people unfamiliar with German culture to learn stuff about. She'll also do a video every once in a blue moon comparing Germany with Austria and Switzerland about various different subjects like different accents of the places or the differences in food, sometimes she'll even touch within Austria and Switzerland the different regional varieties of various aspects like architecture and folklore (which she already does plenty of concerning just Germany alone).

So I'm wondering who'd be the Vietnam's version of Feli? Preferably if possible a Youtuber content who's not only quite active enough to upload at least one new vid a week but also had lived in America, if not even actually living there right now just like Feli? Hopefully diverse enough in discussed subjects to even do some content every now and then about other regions such as Mường Thanh or Tây Nguyên and not just the famous Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City tourists centers?

I never gave him any way to contact me online, and yet he was somehow able to find my Instagram, probably by reverse searching the photos he took of me.

I set my profile to extremely private, but not before he messaged me a close up picture of me on my scooter, which clearly showed my licence plate.

Travelled over a dozen provinces and cities around Vietnam. Always felt Nha Trang would be dull so it never made it. Today I succumbed to the temptation, even dull places can be worth it. I confirm this city is the most terrible, of all the tourist centric places in Vietnam.

Mega large hotel accomodation buildings scattering the city, serviced by underpaid and overworked staff of course. Near those hotels, taxi drivers trying to scam you . Asking triple the price, then not letting you to after being declined. Soliciting is ever present, which is OK, but the desperate attitude, is emotionally exhausting.

Poorly cared for bars and pubs, stinky joints with the typical young girls outside hooking pedestrians. That isn't the only city in Vietnam where you would see that, but elsewhere the place is beautiful, at least decent. So next to the stinky holes, you jump straight up to ""luxury"" caterings. You read up the reviews and see many fake 5 stars praising the venue, but also the genuine ones stating they get scammed with the bill, or that a drink costs even more than in Korea. Oh, and on your way home you will likely go through some street where literally prostitutes in the street would wink at you.

My hope was that given the overall drop of tourism, the economic structure of a place like this would have adapted by now. Converting things into more authentic Vietnam. Oh no. They don't seem to get it at all in Nha Trang. In Nha Trang, people remember the good days when rich Russians would pour loads of money freshly converter or washed up at the cash exchanges. They insist, convincing themselves those days will come back soon, soon, soon.

Don't go to Nha Trang, Phan Tiet is orders of magnitudes better. Any sea side city in Vietnam, even quiet villages, I suppose especially quiet villages for many of us, is far more enjoyable, and will cost you less.

While trying to book my ride, a sweet gentleman approached asked if i needed a ride, said he would charge the same as Grab which was around 300k.

It was early morning and i was very tired so i agreed. However, during our ride we stopped at 2 toll booths for which he supposedly paid. When we arrived at the hotel, i had 300k ready for him and gave it to him but he said i needed to pay for the toll as well and handed me 2 receipts of 250k and 350k bringing the total to 900k. I knew something was wrong and i tried to argue with him why would the grab app show 300k total. The dude wouldn't open his booth for my luggage and kinda got aggressive. 

It was my first trip overseas and i was very tired, gave him 900k and got to my hotel.

Later found out that there are supposed to be NO toll booths on the way from the Airport. Taxi drivers and toll booth agents team up for this scam. My return ride was booked by my hotel and costed 250k in total and yes ofcourse no toll booths.

Arrived at Hanoi Airport, fell into a fake ""Grab driver"" taxi scam. 100% my fault.

My driver didn't speak English and refused to tell me the total fare. I broke into a cold sweat, getting anxious and panicking a little inside. Minutes passed and something clicked in my brain. I decided to call my hotel using Whatsapp. Explained the situation to the front desk lady and put her on speaker phone. Front desk lady had a *long conversation* with the taxi driver in Vietnamese. I could tell that his scam was unraveling when her voice got louder but he was trying to keep his cool lol

While the front desk lady was putting him on blast, she simultaneously messaged me the exact dong to pay him on Whatsapp. She told me to show the driver the message after I arrived at the hotel. Did exactly that. Showed the driver the message, paid in cash, grabbed my bag and ran into the hotel. ALL of the front desk workers were clapping and I gave the lady a big hug for saving my ass.

**TL;DR**

IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AIRPORT TAXI SCAM:  
(Assuming you have a charged phone w/ data upon arrival)

\- Call your hotel/airbnb host/hostel using Whatsapp  
\- Explain that you're in the middle of a scam and need help  
\- Ask the front desk/host to speak to the driver in Vietnamese  
\- Ask the front desk/host to message you the fare on Whatsapp  
\- When you arrive at your accommodation, SHOW the driver the message and then pay

We run by the meter"" and so dumb old me who trusted the meter was like oh ok good let's go. Lo and behold 10 mins later I got dropped to my destination and the meter showed 500k. I was dumbfounded.

Third day in Vietnam! Yesterday we had a full day with a private guide all for us and was a beautiful day!  We went at Mekong delta with a private boat, a small tour in bycicle and many other activities and it was beautiful!

Going back at the hotel there was a bit of traffic, so we did very late. I was thinking how much tip to give to the guide and to the driver. Was 200.000 to the driver and 300.000 to the autist. But I have seen that I had just 3x100.000 and 6x500.000

So before finishing the tour I decided to give 300.000 to the driver and 500.000 to our guide.

In our hotel when the driver was gone and only the guide was with us telling us the last thing, we said goodbye and I gave here 500.000. 
She recognized the 500.000 bill immediately and she was super embarrassed, telling me it's too much, I insisted, but she continued to tell us no. She gave us a hug and went back home.

All tracked time is active, 100% focused on the task at hand.

Passive listening time I estimate at 600 additional inattentive hours. I don't really do this anymore.

*Starting from:* English monolingual beta

*Current strategy:* Consume fiction

*Long-term goal:* D1 fluency and a paid original fiction publication by 2040

*Past updates:*

* [530 hours](https://reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/16qrqux/report_on_530_hours_of_active_vietnamese_practice/)
* [1000 hours](https://reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1bxs5ag/report_on_1000_hours_of_active_vietnamese_practice/)

*Current level:*

* Can watch movies and television in a few genres in Vietnamese without subtitles and follow the plot and all the dialogue in 3/5 scenes. These genres are romance and fantasy war. When I don't understand a sentence, I can usually explain why. Like I know which words I didn't understand.
* Can watch lectures on topics of interest in Vietnamese and understand enough to hold my attention. In terms of word coverage it's like 70% or 80% so I'm missing a huge amount but it's still fun.
* _Finished_ my first novel in Vietnamese with dictionary, at a comprehension level I could actually enjoy. It was Cô Nàng Cửa Hàng Tiện Ích by Sayaka Murata, translated by An Vy, which I'd read in English already.
* Can talk with _tutors_  about non-special domains. Gossip is okay, plots of shows and books are good topics, but nothing too specific like recipes, history, economics, law, etc. This is not replicable with non-tutors. 

*Rejected Strategies:*

* Apps (too boring)
* Grammar explanations (too boring)
* Drills, exercises, or other artificial output (too boring)
* Content made for language learners (maximum boring)
* Classes (too lazy for them, and not sold on the value prop)

*Previously rejected strategies that became useful*

* Studying explanations of the sound system: In _A Vietnamese Reference Grammar_, which I read the sound system chapter of, I learned that some tones (most notably dấu hỏi and dấu ngang) completely change based on their position in the sentence. dấu ngang is often described as a ""flat"" tone but actually it drops in pitch the fastest of any tone when it's got heavy stress at the end of a pause group, and also these pause groups are grammatically predictable, though probabalistic. This is something no tutor or native speaker I know of has ever said, but it explained a lot of anomalies I was hearing, both in my listening practice and out of my own mouth. Cheers to the linguists.
* Perception drills: in the beginning these were absolutely useless and evil, but after I got to the point where only a few stubborn vowel clusters remained which I still struggled to distinguish, a few sessions of [minimal pair training](https://inarticulate.xyz/posts/minimal-pair-training/) provided value.

*Reflection on last update:*

The main thing that's different now versus at 1000 hours is how much more fun learning the language is. I can read literature and experience entire passages (rarely full pages, never full chapters) without needing to look anything up. This experience of the language is so much fuller than it was at the word level, or even the sentence level. I get the faintest hints of speakers' and writers' personalities coming through in their grammar and diction.

Interviews are harder to follow, but I think by 2000 hours I'll be able to just casually put on a Vietcetera interview with an author or translator and enjoy what they have to say.

This is, I think, the fabled ""crossing over point"" for first-time adult language learners where there is no more doubt.

As far as my conversational ability goes, it _must_ be better than it was 500 hours ago, like logically that must be the case, but it continues to feel worse. My estimate of 4000 hours for being comfortably conversational is looking pretty spot on about now.

*Methods:*

A big change in my methods after last update is that I now follow a schedule. I used to worry every day about whether I'd have time after work to practice Vietnamese. To fix that I now put in two hours every day before work, with this routine:

* Anki audio-only sentence card review (15m): This is the best exercises for my listening ability I've found. Basically I hear the sentence, transcribe it in my head and understand the meaning, then check my transcription and understanding by flipping the card. I attribute my strong listening development to this immediate-feedback practice. It was inspired by what I read in the book _Peak_ about efficient language learners.
* Intensive listening (30m): I step through a show with subtitles. I find lots of dubs with matching subs on Netflix (Analog Squad, Ready Set Love, Business Proposal, Our Beloved Summer, etc). If I find a sentence with ONE (exactly one) unknown word, I use asbplayer to send it to my anki deck, with original audio, with one click. An addon called Intellifiller uses gpt4 api to add an English translation on the back for me, which is almost always correct. Note about Viet subs on Netflix: there's a secret hidden Viet sub track on most dubs, that matches word for word, which you can find by setting audio to Viet, refreshing, _then_ setting the subs to Viet.
* Extensive listening (30m): I watch a show without subtitles. This is usually a show I've studied before intensively, or one I've watched in English, or some tv soap I couldn't possibly get confused by. I often repeat dense stuff a few days in a row.
* Intensive Reading (45m): I read a novel with dictionary and repeatedly read sentences or passages as necessary to grok.

After work, if I feel like it and have time, I'll extensively read manga or extensively watch a Vietnamese show.

*Time Breakdown:*

I use `atracker` on iOS since it's got a quick interface on apple watch.

* 58% listening (865h09m)
* 32% reading (483h50m)
* 6% conversation (91h34m)
* 4% anki audio sentence recognition cards (61h39m)

*Pros/cons of my methods:*

On the pro side:

* My vocab and comprehension are beefed according to my tutors.
* My speech is clear enough. When I'm not understood in conversation, it's almost always because I've said ungrammatical nonsense or used the wrong words rather than pronunciation issues.

On the con side:

* If I had more output practice, chorusing practice, that kind of thing, it's possible that would improve my perception when listening and reading, improve my ability to notice what I need. But I just don't like that stuff very much and I'm content to let it arrive late.

On the idk side:

* Without explicit speech instruction, I've picked up sounds from all dialects of Vietnamese. All tutors I have spoken with have pointed this out and said it was odd, but not a problem.

Other thoughts:

In my last update, I noted as a con that my methods may not be as efficient as some hypothetical ""practical"" way to learn that could get someone through daily interactions. Since then, I've become skeptical that such a method exists, or that if it does it could get any mileage outside a classroom setting. The amount of hours of sustained, regular practice it took me to reliably recognize common words like ""đang"" as spoken by a variety of speakers suggests to me that there is no shortcut. Or I have a learning disability.

**Recording**

Last time there was a request for this so I'm including a recording. I don't practice pronunciation outside of reading or chatting, so this isn't offered as impressive results of the method; it's honest.

Here's me reading an excerpt from Giáo Sư và Công Thức Toán by Yoko Ogawa, translated by Lương Việt Dũng: [recording](https://audio.com/inarticulatexyz/audio/1500).

*Recommendations*

I'm not yet fluent so I have no qualifications to give advice. My next update, which I'll write at 2000 hours, may contain different opinions.

That said, my advice for Vietnamese learners now is:

* All the pain is front-loaded. Your early days will be the worst part of the experience. It only gets better. Long before fluency, the experience of learning can become one of the best and most rewarding parts of your daily life.
* Choose intervals to assess your progress and otherwise forget about it. Build a system of habits, and let the question of eventual fluency fade from your thoughts. The system will take care of it for you. If you practice with a good system every day, it can't not happen. That's as much a fact as that things thrown up will eventually fall down.
* Relax! Nothing that you don't understand is urgent. No error in your output is urgent. A time will come when it's productive to consult the linguists, and that time will be when you're relaxed, when you've noticed a pattern you want a hint at understanding, but can accept not understanding it if you're not ready. The patience game here has a steep learning curve. It can be hard when approaching a language with a sound system this complex (and multiple of them) to accept that after a year or whatever of study you still can mistake ""hello good morning"" for a totally different phrase. But it _does arrive_ eventually.
* As a language learner, you are always a descriptive linguist. If native speakers say it that way, that's how it's said.
* Content by and for native speakers or bust. Even from the start.

I have taken a few sleeperbuses before, not a super fan because I usually can't sleep, but there weren't many options, so I thought ""what the heck, let's try"". The whole journey is around 7h or something like that, and started at 22:30. 

At 01:30 we stopped for a toilet break. Now, I had actually slept a bit, even with the crazy driving the do here, so I was rather in a good mood. I try not to drink too much before sleeperbuses, just because it sucks to go out, but I had to go, so meh... got out, was one of the last I think...yucky toilet, dark, no light, meh... did my business, came out, saw that all the doors of the other toilets were open and thought I must be the last one... and what a crazy thing it would be if the bus didn't wait for me. 

Turned the corner...the bus was...gone.

Slight panic attack -- what do you do when the bus is gone - you're in a foreign country, you can't talk the language, it's the night, you're alone next to a highway...

Fortunately I had my passport, wallet, phone with 50% battery -- so even though I was stranded I had something to get by.

Still there's something with being left behind in a foreign country-- you feel small and utterly insignicant 😂😂

After trying to call a Vietnamese number of the hostel  I had been staying at (they had booked the bus) and failing, calling another with no answer, my newfound friend I had met briefly on the bus and very luckily connected with on Instagram called me -- I had been just about to call her, praying she was not sleeping -- she had already gotten the bus driver to turn and go back for me ❤️ 

I had to wait for a short while, be confused by another bus that came to the same place for their toilet stop (the bus looked exactly the same, except for the slippers), then the bus came -- with a grumpy driver waving me to get inside. On the way to my bed I was met with a few confused faces looking out of their beds and one guy laughing because he understood what had happened --- to be honest the whole thing was comical and a tiny bit traumatizing, I was very very grateful to my friend!! ❤️❤️

I am still a bit shaky, and can't sleep now -- adrenaline I guess -- and am wondering what would have happened if I didn't have my phone or my friend that by luck happened to check my bed. I guess it would have worked out, but would have taken much more time.

Has anything like this happened to anyone else? Please share! ☺️

This post is to share our (entirely positive) experience and compensate for all the negativity you can find online when researching the Ha Giang Loop.

We did a 3D2N trip. We only did half of the main loop and then cut in the middle due to time constraints. Our itinerary was (as shown on the map):

[Our itinerary](https://preview.redd.it/8zeg6i4fcz0e1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3cb004ea823cd8068ff5a380dfdeabc11163d4e)

1. Leaving Ha Giang, going to Dong Van to sleep there on the first night (stop A)
2. Then, continuing to Pai Lung (stop B), Meo Vac, and finishing the day sleeping in a super local village (Duong Thuong) where there is just one hostel (stop C)
3. Then come back to Ha Giang on the third day

Relevant information:

1. We took a semi-automatic motorbike with 110cc
2. My girlfriend (the driver) had the International Driving Permit (IDP) emitted in Switzerland
3. She had never driven a motorbike like this before, only an automatic scooter (back home, she wouldn't be allowed to ride a semi-automatic motorbike, but the A1 class in Vietnam allows for up to 175cc)
4. We were lucky (or maybe we came in the right season), and we had blue sky during the whole trip

The main road is flawless, and the minor roads are also in excellent condition (as shown in the picture below). All the pavement is brand new, and there is no risk whatsoever of an accident due to bad road conditions (except if you detour like we did: when we took DT181 to go from C to Ha Giang, some parts were quite bad as you can see in the other picture, but nothing to worry about if you just go slow). Also, the IDP was fundamental because the police stopped us twice, but as soon as we showed them the IDP, they let us go immediately. The semi-automatic motorbike is a must, since there are steep parts that, without the gears, become impossible. I believe the route can be tricky if the weather is not good. Still, that kind of happens anywhere in the world - driving a motorbike in the rain is always much more risky than with a blue sky.

[The \\""bad\\"" parts of the road when we detoured from the main highway](https://preview.redd.it/ujgoi1zyzn0e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6096e7e1616d89deb494b04a14e9f6d257572d85)

[How 99&#37; of the road looks like](https://preview.redd.it/zutp61zyzn0e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d3f148fe54276b7b15344b687b6fc556016d631)

If you don’t know how to drive a scooter or a motorbike, you have no choice but to take an easy driver. However, if you do know, we believe that taking a group tour is not a good idea. They stop forever to eat and take pictures, decide where to stop, and you even pay triple than doing it on your own.

Hence, we highly recommend doing the trip yourself. If you do it, then our pieces of advice are:

1. Do the IDP if possible because they ask for it.
2. Rent a semi-automatic or a manual motorbike.
3. Don’t do the loop if it’s rainy - just wait for good weather, both for your safety and to enjoy the views and the journey.
4. Just drive as your common sense dictates: don’t make reckless moves, use the horn when it’s necessary (here, everyone uses it to make other people aware of their presence), don’t abuse speed, and be cautious with what other drivers do (locals drive pretty fast, so pay attention to what other drivers do and let them overtake you if they want - you are not in a rush, and they probably are).

We had read that the path was terrible, that many accidents took place, that you needed to be a super experienced mountain driver to pull it off, and that doing it with 2 people on the motorbike was extremely risky. The truth is that the trip could not have been more chill. I believe there is a considerable bias in the comments you can find online. It must be full of stupid tourists who never rode a motorbike and suddenly think they can do it on a highway just because they are in Vietnam. Ha Giang Loop is a safe trip for anyone who can drive a motorbike; don’t let other posts or comments discourage you.",False,False,0.96,"","2024-11-13 12:45:32","2024-11-15 02:54:27"

Some examples of the questions that should be posted here:

- Questions that can be answered with just Yes/No

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

About the changelog.

I've made some changes to the sub:

- Re-writing the rules to make them more concise. Adding Vietnamese.
- Remove some unnecessary flairs.
- Big change: Switching r/Vietnam to a dual-language subreddit. This is based on the fact that the number of Vietnamese people in this sub has increased significantly. I know this is controversial and some of you don't like this but I think we should just give it a try.
- Making a Discord server. This is after r/place event that I realized we need a place to handle future events like this better and for the ease of casual, chit-chat type of conversations.",False,True,0.98,"","2022-04-06 17:54:06","2025-02-09 03:33:46"
